Attached organisms of both Col- and Col V, I-K94+ strains showed the effect but with prolonged exposure to pH 2·5, the attached Col V+ organisms appeared more resistant than the attached Col- ones, possibly because they formed a thicker surface layer. It is proposed that the increased resistance of attached organisms to pH 2·5 might allow the survival, in gastric acid, of organisms attached to food particles. This would be more significant for the Col V+ strains because the plasmid enhances enterobacterial attachment properties.

The intracellular environment of macrophages is one of the most stressful environments encountered by an invading bacterium during the course of infection. To study the role of the major stress protein, DnaK, of L. monocytogenes in survival under intracellular stress induced by macrophage-phagocytosis as well as under extracellular environmental stresses, we cloned, sequenced, and analyzed the dnaK locus from L. monocytogenes. Then we constructed an insertional mutation in the dnaK gene by homologous recombination and characterized it. Sequencing has revealed that the dnaK locus consists of four open reading frames in the order hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. The mutant grows neither at temperatures above 39°C nor under acidic conditions e.g. pH 3.0. Using the macrophage cell line JA-4, the ability of the dnaK mutant to grow intracellularly was examined. Immediately after phagocytosis, the number of viable dnaK mutant bacteria found within macrophages was significantly lower compared to that of intracellular wild type bacteria. However, following a 1–3 h latency period, the mutant multiplied in a similar fashion to the wild type within macrophage cells. A quantitative analysis of intracellular bacteria in macrophage cells by microscope and a binding assay of bacteria to the surface of macrophages by ELISA revealed that the lower number of viable dnaK mutant in macrophages after phagocytosis is due to the low efficiency of phagocytosis resulting from the reduced binding capacity of the dnaK mutant. These results demonstrate that DnaK of L. monocytogenes is essentially required for survival under high temperatures and acidic conditions. Though it does not largely contribute to the survival of L. monocytogenes in macrophage cells, it is essential for efficient phagocytosis. This is the first evidence that DnaK is required for the efficient phagocytosis of a facultative intracellular pathogen with macrophages.",1999-06,,2020-05-09 14:11:00,2020-05-09 14:11:00,118-128,,2,4,,Cell Stress Chaperones,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 10547061 PMCID: PMC312926,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/77XYXVS6/Hanawa et al. - 1999 - The Listeria monocytogenes DnaK chaperone is requi.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC312926/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, growth behaviour",Listeria monocytogenes,"10403S

The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system is one of the principal systems utilized by the bacterium to cope with acid stress, a reaction that produces γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) from glutamate. Recently, we have shown that GABA can accumulate intracellularly under acidic conditions, even under conditions where no extracellular glutamate-GABA exchange is detectable. The GABA shunt, a pathway that metabolizes GABA to succinate, has been described for several other bacterial genera, and the present study sought to determine whether L. monocytogenes has this metabolic capacity, which, if present, could provide a possible route for succinate biosynthesis in L. monocytogenes. Using crude protein extracts from L. monocytogenes EGD-e, we show that this strain exhibits activity for the two main enzyme reactions in the GABA shunt, GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSDH). Two genes were identified as candidates for encoding these enzyme activities, argD (GABA-AT) and lmo0913 (SSDH). Crude protein extracts prepared from a mutant lacking a functional argD gene significantly reduced GABA-AT activity, while an lmo0913 mutant lost all detectable SSDH activity. The deletion of lmo0913 increased the acid tolerance of EGD-e and showed an increased accumulation of intracellular GABA, suggesting that this pathway plays a significant role in the survival of this pathogen under acidic conditions. This is the first report of such a pathway in the genus Listeria, which highlights an important link between metabolism and acid tolerance and also presents a possible compensatory pathway to partially overcome the incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle of Listeria.",2013-01-01,,2020-04-30 15:15:11,2020-04-30 15:15:11,74-80,,1,79,,Appl.

As a consequence, L. monocytogenes is extremely difficult to control along the entire food chain from production to storage and consumption. Frequent and recent outbreaks of L. monocytogenes infections illustrate that current measures of decontamination and preservation are suboptimal to control L. monocytogenes in food. In order to develop efficient measures to prevent contamination during processing and control growth during storage of food it is crucial to understand the mechanisms utilized by L. monocytogenes to tolerate the stress conditions in food matrices and food processing environments. Food-related stress conditions encountered by L. monocytogenes along the food chain are acidity, oxidative and osmotic stress, low or high temperatures, presence of bacteriocins and other preserving additives, and stresses as a consequence of applying alternative decontamination and preservation technologies such high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed and continuous UV light, pulsed electric fields (PEF). This review is aimed at providing a summary of the current knowledge on the response of L. monocytogenes toward these stresses and the mechanisms of stress resistance employed by this important food-borne bacterium.

This acid resistance property contributes to the low infectious dose of pathogenic E. coli species. One very efficient E. coli acid resistance system encompasses two isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase (gadA and gadB) and a putative glutamate:γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) antiporter (gadC). The system is subject to complex controls that vary with growth media, growth phase, and growth pH. Previous work has revealed that the system is controlled by two sigma factors, two negative regulators (cyclic AMP receptor protein [CRP] and H-NS), and an AraC-like regulator called GadX. Earlier evidence suggested that the GadX protein acts both as a positive and negative regulator of the gadA and gadBC genes depending on environmental conditions. New data clarify this finding, revealing a collaborative regulation between GadX and another AraC-like regulator called GadW (previously YhiW). GadX and GadW are DNA binding proteins that form homodimers in vivo and are 42% homologous to each other. GadX activates expression of gadA and gadBC at any pH, while GadW inhibits GadX-dependent activation. Regulation of gadA and gadBC by either regulator requires an upstream, 20-bp GAD box sequence. Northern blot analysis further indicates that GadW represses expression of gadX. The results suggest a control circuit whereby GadW interacts with both the gadA and gadX promoters. GadW clearly represses gadX and, in situations where GadX is missing, activates gadA and gadBC. GadX, however, activates only gadA and gadBC expression. CRP also represses gadX expression. It does this primarily by repressing production of sigma S, the sigma factor responsible for gadX expression. In fact, the acid induction of gadA and gadBC observed when rich-medium cultures enter stationary phase corresponds to the acid induction of sigma S production. These complex control circuits impose tight rein over expression of the gadA and gadBC system yet provide flexibility for inducing acid resistance under many conditions that presage acid stress.",2002-12,,2020-05-13 14:26:42,2020-05-13 14:26:42,7001-7012,,24,184,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 12446650 PMCID: PMC135476,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BQQB5JHJ/Ma et al. - 2002 - Collaborative Regulation of Escherichia coli Gluta.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC135476/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Genetics,Escherichia coli,"EK227

Early-stationary-phase cells (12-h culture) of the mutant decreased by ca. 4 log10CFU/ml while the parent strain decreased by approximately 2 log10 CFU/ml. No significant differences in the survival of late-stationary-phase cells (24-h culture) between the parent strain and the mutant were observed, although numbers of the parent strain declined less in the initial 1 h of acid challenge.

Complementation of the mutant with a functional dps gene restored acid and hydrogen peroxide tolerance to levels equal to or greater than those exhibited by the parent strain.

To characterize acid resistance of EHEC under conditions simulating the gastric environment, survival was measured in a model stomach system (MSS) for two clonal groups of EHEC: 14 EHEC 1 strains of serotype O157:H7 and 12 EHEC 2 strains of serotypes O26:H11 and O111:H8. There were significant differences between the two EHEC groups, with the average survival rate of O157 strains in the MSS twice as great as the O26/O111 strains. Strains of the two groups also differed in the quantity of injured cells in MSS and in the transcript levels of the glutamate decarboxylase genes (measured by quantitative PCR) in stationary phase before cultures entered the MSS. The results indicate that E. coli O157:H7 strains have superior ability to survive simulated gastric acidity compared with the non-O157 EHEC.

Arginine-dependent acid resistance depends on an intracellular proton-utilizing arginine α-decarboxylase and a membrane transport protein necessary for delivering arginine to and removing agmatine, its decarboxylation product, from the cytoplasm. The arginine system afforded significant protection to wild-type E. coli cells in our acid shock experiments. The gene coding for the transport protein is identified here as a putative membrane protein of unknown function, YjdE, which we now name adiC. Strains from which this gene is deleted fail to mount arginine-dependent XAR, and they cannot perform coupled transport of arginine and agmatine. Homologues of this gene are found in other bacteria in close proximity to homologues of the arginine decarboxylase in a gene arrangement pattern similar to that in E coli. Evidence for a lysine-dependent XAR system in E. coli is also presented.

Cells were incubated in combinations of three concentrations of lactic acid medium (3, 4.75, and 15 mM) and three external pH's (pHex 5.0, 6.0, and 6.5), plus, a HCl control, and a blank control (pH 7.4). Results showed that lactic acid induced lower log reduction of all three strains when challenged in severe acid conditions (pH 3.0) after being habituated at a pHex of 5.5 or 6.0 until the log phase, compared with a pHex of 6.5 or the two controls. This indicates that when the pHex was either 5.5 or 6.0 this induced a higher ATR of the strains, which may be caused by the ability of the strains to retain intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis with pHi maintained in the range of 7.4-7.9. It was also found that a pHex of 5.5 resulted in the highest pHi of the strains across all incubated conditions, which indicates that the pHi may play an important role in the induction of ATR when Listeria cells are habituated in lactic acid, and if the higher pHi can be maintained, the ATR would be stronger. The concentration of lactic acid per se has no significant effect on ATR, which it is proposed was due to the pHi homeostasis maintained within the cells. However, the difference in ATR among three strains was also significant, which cannot be explained by the stable pHi of all tested strains. Therefore, other underlying mechanisms to mediate ATR under different conditions need to be explored in further studies.",2020-04,,2020-04-29 15:13:53,,253-261,,4,17,,Foodborne Pathog.

In the present study we investigated the impact of a sigB deletion on the proteome of L. monocytogenes grown in a chemically defined medium both in the presence and in the absence of osmotic stress (0.5 M NaCl). Two new phenotypes associated with the sigB deletion were identified using this medium. (i) Unexpectedly, the strain with the DeltasigB deletion was found to grow faster than the parent strain in the growth medium, but only when 0.5 M NaCl was present. This phenomenon was independent of the carbon source provided in the medium. (ii) The DeltasigB mutant was found to have unusual Gram staining properties compared to the parent, suggesting that sigma(B) contributes to the maintenance of an intact cell wall. A proteomic analysis was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, using cells growing in the exponential and stationary phases. Overall, 11 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the wild type and the DeltasigB mutant; 10 of these proteins were expressed at lower levels in the mutant, and 1 was overexpressed in the mutant. All 11 proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, and putative functions were assigned based on homology to proteins from other bacteria. Five proteins had putative functions related to carbon utilization (Lmo0539, Lmo0783, Lmo0913, Lmo1830, and Lmo2696), while three proteins were similar to proteins whose functions are unknown but that are known to be stress inducible (Lmo0796, Lmo2391, and Lmo2748). To gain further insight into the role of sigma(B) in L. monocytogenes, we deleted the genes encoding four of the proteins, lmo0796, lmo0913, lmo2391, and lmo2748. Phenotypic characterization of the mutants revealed that Lmo2748 plays a role in osmotolerance, while Lmo0796, Lmo0913, and Lmo2391 were all implicated in acid stress tolerance to various degrees. Invasion assays performed with Caco-2 cells indicated that none of the four genes was required for mammalian cell invasion. Microscopic analysis suggested that loss of Lmo2748 might contribute to the cell wall defect observed in the DeltasigB mutant. Overall, this study highlighted two new phenotypes associated with the loss of sigma(B). It also demonstrated clear roles for sigma(B) in both osmotic and low-pH stress tolerance and identified specific components of the sigma(B) regulon that contribute to the responses observed.",2008-10-01,,2020-04-28 13:57:18,,6848-58,,,74,,Applied and environmental microbiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/4D6GQAXV/Abram et al. - 2008 - Identification of Components of the Sigma B Regulo.pdf;,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23269924_Identification_of_Components_of_the_Sigma_B_Regulon_in_Listeria_monocytogenes_That_Contribute_to_Acid_and_Salt_Tolerance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, proteomics",Listeria monocytogenes,10403S,"brain heart infusion

Here, we traced additional such regulators by identifying regulons with co-ordinately altered expression in a lon mutant by genome-wide transcriptional profiling. Besides many members of the RcsA regulon (which validates our approach as RcsA is a known Lon substrate), many genes of the sigmaS-dependent general stress response were upregulated in the lon mutant. However, the lon mutation did not affect sigmaS levels nor sigmaS activity in general, suggesting specific effects of Lon on secondary regulators involved in the control of subsets of sigmaS-controlled genes. Lon-affected genes also included the major acid resistance genes (gadA, gadBC, gadE, hdeAB and hdeD), which led to the discovery that the essential acid resistance regulator GadE (whose expression is sigmaS-controlled) is degraded in vivo in a Lon-dependent manner. GadE proteolysis is constitutive as it was observed even under conditions that induce the system (i.e. at low pH or during entry into stationary phase).

This property is thought to contribute to the low infectious dose of the organism. Three acid resistance (AR) systems are expressed in stationary-phase cells. AR system 1 is σS dependent, while AR systems 2 and 3 are glutamate and arginine dependent, respectively. In this study, we sought to determine which AR systems are important for survival in acidic foods and which are required for survival in the bovine intestinal tract. Wild-type and mutant E. coli O157:H7 strains deficient in AR system 1, 2, or 3 were challenged with apple cider and inoculated into calves. Wild-type cells, adapted at pH 5.5 in the absence of glucose (AR system 1 induced), survived well in apple cider. Conversely, the mutant deficient in AR system 1, shown previously to survive poorly in calves, was susceptible to apple cider (pH 3.5), and this sensitivity was shown to be caused by low pH. Interestingly, the AR system 2-deficient mutant survived in apple cider at high levels, but its shedding from calves was significantly decreased compared to that of wild-type cells. AR system 3-deficient cells survived well in both apple cider and calves. Taken together, these results indicate that E. coli O157:H7 utilizes different acid resistance systems based on the type of acidic environment encountered.",2004-08,,2020-05-26 14:37:10,2020-05-26 14:37:10,4792-4799,,8,70,,Appl Environ Microbiol,Acid Resistance Systems Required for Survival of Escherichia coli O157,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15294816 PMCID: PMC492388,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/QDXPENLG/Price et al. - 2004 - Acid Resistance Systems Required for Survival of E.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC492388/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Growth behaviour,Escherichia coli,"ATCC 43895

Approximately 56% of the Scott A proteome was quantitatively assessable, and the data provides insight into its acquired acid tolerance response (ATR) as well as the relation of the ATR to the growth phase transition. Alterations in protein abundance due to acid stress were focused in proteins belonging to the L. monocytogenes common genome, with few strain-dependent proteins involved. However, one of the two complete prophage genomes appeared to enter lysogeny. During progressive acidification, the growth rate and yield were reduced 55% and 98%, respectively, in comparison to nonacidified control cultures. The maintenance of the growth rate was determined to be connected to activation of cytoplasmic pH homeostatic mechanisms while cellular reproductive-related and cell component turnover proteins were markedly more abundant in acid stressed cultures. Cell biomass accumulation was impeded predominantly due to repression of phosphodonor-linked enzymes involved with sugar phosphotransfer, glycolysis, and cell wall polymer biosynthesis. Acidification caused a shift from heterofermentation to an oxidatively stressed state in which ATP appears to be generated mainly through the pyruvate dehydrogenase/pyruvate oxidase/phosphotransacetylase/acetate kinase and branched chain acid dehydrogenase pathways. Analysis of regulons indicated energy conservation occurs due to repression by the GTP/isoleucine sensor CodY and also the RelA mediated stringent response.

The impact of low-temperature coupled with pH decrease for global gene expression and subsequent virulence properties, however, has not been elucidated. Results qRT-PCR revealed for the first time a transient, acid triggered prfA induction of approximately 4-fold, 5.7-fold, 7-fold and 9.3-fold 60 to 90 min after acid shock of L. monocytogenes at 37°C, 25°C, 18°C, and 10°C, respectively. Comparable data were obtained for seven different L. monocytogenes strains, demonstrating that prfA induction under these conditions is a general response of L. monocytogenes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the in vivo-relevant genes bsh, clpP, glpD, hfq, inlA, inlB, inlE, lisR, and lplA1 as well as many other genes with a putative role during infection are transiently induced upon acid shock conducted at 25°C and 37°C. Twenty-five genes repressed upon acid shock are known to be down regulated during intracellular growth or by virulence regulators. These data were confirmed by qRT-PCR of twelve differentially regulated genes and by the identification of acid shock-induced genes influenced by σB. To test if up regulation of virulence genes at temperatures below 37°C correlates with pathogenicity, the capacity of L. monocytogenes to invade epithelial cells after acid shock at 25°C was measured. A 12-fold increased number of intracellular bacteria was observed (acid shock, t = 60 min) that was reduced after adaptation to the level of the unshocked control. This increased invasiveness was shown to be in line with the induction of inlAB. Using a nematode infection assay, we demonstrated that Caenorhabditis elegans fed with acid-shocked L. monocytogenes exhibits a shorter time to death of 50% (TD50) of the worms (6.4 days) compared to infection with unshocked bacteria (TD50 = 10.2 days). Conclusions PrfA and other listerial virulence genes are induced by an inorganic acid in a temperature-dependent manner. The data presented here suggest that low pH serves as a trigger for listerial pathogenicity at environmental temperatures.",2013-04-27,,2020-05-09 14:20:09,2020-05-09 14:20:09,285,,,14,,BMC Genomics,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 23622257 PMCID: PMC3648428,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BSX3IVYT/Neuhaus et al. - 2013 - Acid shock of Listeria monocytogenes at low enviro.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648428/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, biochemistry",Listeria monocytogenes,"EGD-e

In this study, we investigated the impact of a sigB null mutation on the survival of L. monocytogenes EGD-e at low pH, during high-hydrostatic-pressure treatment, and during freezing. The survival of ΔsigB mutant exponential-phase cells at pH 2.5 was 10,000-fold lower than the survival of EGD-e wild-type cells. Moreover, the ΔsigB mutant failed to show an acid tolerance response. Upon preexposure for 1 h to pH 4.5, the survival at pH 2.5 was 100,000-fold lower for the ΔsigB mutant than for the wild type. The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) acid resistance system is important in survival and adaptation of L. monocytogenes in acidic conditions. The σB dependence of the gad genes (gadA, gadB, gadC, gadD, and gadE) was analyzed in silico. Putative σB-dependent promoter sites were found upstream of the gadCB operon (encoding a glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate antiporter and a glutamate decarboxylase, respectively) and the lmo2434 gene (gadD, encoding a putative glutamate decarboxylase). Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that expression of the gadCB operon and expression of gadD are indeed σB dependent. In addition, a proteomics approach was used to analyze the protein expression profiles upon acid exposure. Although the GAD proteins were not recovered, nine proteins accumulated in the wild type but not in the ΔsigB strain. These proteins included Pfk, GalE, ClpP, and Lmo1580. Exposure to pH 4.5, in order to preload cells with active σB and consequently with σ B-dependent general stress proteins, also provided considerable protection against high-hydrostatic-pressure treatment and freezing. The combined data argue that the expression of σB-dependent genes provides L. monocytogenes with nonspecific multiple-stress resistance that may be relevant for survival in the natural environment as well as during food processing.",2004-06-01,,2020-04-12 08:47:52,2020-04-12 08:47:52,3457-3466,,6,70,,Appl.

A typical TCS transduces the signal by a phosphorelay between the sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator. Recently, small-sized proteins that link TCSs have been reported and are called “connectors.” Their physiological roles, however, have remained elusive. SafA (sensor associating factor A) (formerly B1500), a small (65-amino-acid [65-aa]) membrane protein, is among such connectors and links Escherichia coli TCSs EvgS/EvgA and PhoQ/PhoP. Since the activation of the EvgS/EvgA system induces acid resistance, we examined whether the SafA-activated PhoQ/PhoP system is also involved in the acid resistance induced by EvgS/EvgA. Using a constitutively active evgS1 mutant for the activation of EvgS/EvgA, we found that SafA, PhoQ, and PhoP all contributed to the acid resistance phenotype. Moreover, EvgS/EvgA activation resulted in the accumulation of cellular RpoS in the exponential-phase cells in a SafA-, PhoQ-, and PhoP-dependent manner. This RpoS accumulation was caused by another connector, IraM, expression of which was induced by the activation of the PhoQ/PhoP system, thus preventing RpoS degradation by trapping response regulator RssB. Acid resistance assays demonstrated that IraM also participated in the EvgS/EvgA-induced acid resistance. Therefore, we propose a model of a signal transduction cascade proceeding from EvgS/EvgA to PhoQ/PhoP and then to RssB (connected by SafA and IraM) and discuss its contribution to the acid resistance phenotype.",2011-03,,2020-05-18 15:59:59,2020-05-18 15:59:59,1222-1228,,5,193,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 21193607 PMCID: PMC3067605,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/WUTE2TNB/Eguchi et al. - 2011 - Regulation of Acid Resistance by Connectors of Two.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067605/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Molecular biology,Escherichia coli,"MG1655

It was found that acid adapted cells treated with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity to low pH stress. Degenerate primers were designed to amplify and sequence a portion of the atpD gene. Subsequently, a PCR product from atpA to atpD was identified. While we were unable to create a deletion in the atpA gene, the plasmid pORI19 was inserted in a region between atpA and atpG to reduce, rather than eliminate, expression of the downstream genes. As expected this mutant displayed enhanced resistance to neomycin and exhibited slower growth than the wild type strain. This mutant could still induce an acid tolerance response and remained susceptible to DCCD treatment, but its relative acid sensitivity was difficult to assess as a consequence of its slow growth.",2000-10-01,,2020-04-13 08:40:43,,137-46,,,60,,International journal of food microbiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12306346_Analysis_of_the_role_of_the_Listeria_monocytogenes_F0F1-ATPase_operon_in_the_acid_tolerance_response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, metabolic pathay",Listeria monocytogenes,LO28,brain–heart infusion and typtone soya broth supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract,"7

A defined medium with glucose as the sole carbon source was used in an aerobic shake flask culture to reliably produce acetoin. Acetoin, the reactive compound in the Voges–Proskauer test, was assayable in the medium and was used to quantify the metabolic response when inhibitors were added to the medium. Inhibitors such as lactic, acetic, propionic and benzoic acids were used to demonstrate the utility of acetoin production as an indicator of metabolic disruption. With increasing levels of inhibitor, the metabolic and growth responses were measured by acetoin production and optical density change, respectively. Both measurements decreased in a similar manner with increasing inhibitor concentrations. The data also showed the apparent mode of action of the inhibitors. A bacteriostatic effect was observed for the protonated organic acids, acetic (4 mmol l−1) and propionic (4 mmol l−1), whereas protonated lactic (4 mmol l−1) and benzoic (0·16 mmol l−1) acids gave an irreversible (apparent bacteriocidal) effect. Lactic, acetic, and propionic acids showed stimulation of metabolic activity at low concentrations, but benzoic did not.

The ability to resist environments in which the pH is 2.5 and below is predicted to contribute significantly to the survival of E. coli during passage through the gastric acid barrier. One acid resistance system imports glutamate from acidic environments and uses it as a proton sink during an intracellular decarboxylation reaction. Transcription of the genes encoding the glutamate decarboxylases and the substrate-product antiporter required for this system is induced under a variety of conditions, including the stationary phase and a low pH. Acid induction during log-phase growth in minimal medium appears to occur through multiple pathways. We recently demonstrated that GadE, the essential activator of the genes, was itself acid induced. In this report we present evidence that there is a regulatory loop involving cross-repression of two AraC-like regulators, GadX and GadW, that can either assist or interfere with GadE activation of the gad decarboxylase and antiporter genes, depending on the culture conditions. Balancing cross-repression appears to be dependent on cAMP and the cAMP regulator protein (CRP). The control loop involves the GadX protein repressing the expression of gadW and the GadW protein repressing or inhibiting RpoS, which is the alternative sigma factor that drives transcription of gadX. CRP and cAMP appear to influence GadX-GadW cross-repression from outside the loop by inhibiting production of RpoS. We found that GadW represses the decarboxylase genes in minimal medium and that growth under acidic conditions lowers the intracellular cAMP levels. These results indicate that CRP and cAMP can mediate pH control over gadX expression and, indirectly, expression of the decarboxylase genes. Mutational or physiological lowering of cAMP levels increases the level of RpoS and thereby increases the production of GadX. Higher GadX levels, in turn, repress gadW and contribute to induction of the gad decarboxylase genes. The presence of multiple pH control pathways governing expression of this acid resistance system is thought to reflect different environmental routes to a low pH.",2003-12,,2020-05-13 14:34:58,2020-05-13 14:34:58,6852-6859,,23,185,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 14617649 PMCID: PMC262709,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/FBARI2QF/Ma et al. - 2003 - pH-Dependent Modulation of Cyclic AMP Levels and G.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC262709/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Escherichia coli,"EK227

Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium buffered at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 8.7. For each of the three pH conditions, cDNA from RNA of five independent cultures was hybridized to Affymetrix E. coli arrays. Analysis of variance with an α level of 0.001 resulted in 98% power to detect genes showing a twofold difference in expression. Normalized expression indices were calculated for each gene and intergenic region (IG). Differential expression among the three pH classes was observed for 763 genes and 353 IGs. Hierarchical clustering yielded six well-defined clusters of pH profiles, designated Acid High (highest expression at pH 5.0), Acid Low (lowest expression at pH 5.0), Base High (highest at pH 8.7), Base Low (lowest at pH 8.7), Neutral High (highest at pH 7.0, lower in acid or base), and Neutral Low (lowest at pH 7.0, higher at both pH extremes). Flagellar and chemotaxis genes were repressed at pH 8.7 (Base Low cluster), where the cell's transmembrane proton potential is diminished by the maintenance of an inverted pH gradient. High pH also repressed the proton pumps cytochrome o (cyo) and NADH dehydrogenases I and II. By contrast, the proton-importing ATP synthase F1Fo and the microaerophilic cytochrome d (cyd), which minimizes proton export, were induced at pH 8.7. These observations are consistent with a model in which high pH represses synthesis of flagella, which expend proton motive force, while stepping up electron transport and ATPase components that keep protons inside the cell. Acid-induced genes, on the other hand, were coinduced by conditions associated with increased metabolic rate, such as oxidative stress. All six pH-dependent clusters included envelope and periplasmic proteins, which directly experience external pH. Overall, this study showed that (i) low pH accelerates acid consumption and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons; (ii) high pH accelerates proton import, while repressing the energy-expensive flagellar and chemotaxis regulons; and (iii) pH differentially regulates a large number of periplasmic and envelope proteins.",2005-01,,2020-05-26 14:39:36,2020-05-26 14:39:36,304-319,,1,187,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15601715 PMCID: PMC538838,,"/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/9UJPXCZD/Maurer et al. - 2005 - pH Regulates Genes for Flagellar Motility, Catabol.pdf;",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC538838/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Escherichia coli,W3110,LBK,"5

It has been described that during acid stress, bacteria internal pH promptly acidifies, followed by recovery. Here, using pH imaging in single living cells, we show that following acid stress, bacteria maintain an acidic cytoplasm and the osmotic stress transcription factor OmpR is required for acidification. The activation of this response is non-canonical, involving a regulatory mechanism requiring the OmpR cognate kinase EnvZ, but not OmpR phosphorylation. Single cell analysis further identifies an intracellular pH threshold ~6.5. Acid stress reduces the internal pH below this threshold, increasing OmpR dimerization and DNA binding. During osmotic stress, the internal pH is above the threshold, triggering distinct OmpR-related pathways. Preventing intracellular acidification of Salmonella renders it avirulent, suggesting that acid stress pathways represent a potential therapeutic target. These results further emphasize the advantages of single cell analysis over studies of population averages., OmpR is a transcription factor activated in acid and osmotic responses of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm.

Activation of recA was shown with a promoter reporter after exposure to low pH and high bile concentrations and during adhesion and invasion of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, an in-frame recA deletion mutant showed reduced survival after exposure to low pH and high bile concentrations.

Additionally, the involvement of Dps in stress resistance has been researched extensively as well. The ability of Dps to provide multifaceted protection is based on three intrinsic properties of the protein: DNA binding, iron sequestration, and its ferroxidase activity. These properties also make Dps extremely important in iron and hydrogen peroxide detoxification and acid resistance as well. Regulation of Dps expression in E. coli is complex and partially dependent on the physiological state of the cell. Furthermore, it is proposed that Dps itself plays a role in gene regulation during starvation, ultimately making the cell more resistant to cytotoxic assaults by controlling the expression of genes necessary for (or deleterious to) stress resistance. The current review focuses on the aforementioned properties of Dps in E. coli, its prototypic organism. The consequences of elucidating the protective mechanisms of this protein are far-reaching, as Dps homologues have been identified in over 1000 distantly related bacteria and Archaea. Moreover, the prevalence of Dps and Dps-like proteins in bacteria suggests that protection involving DNA and iron sequestration is crucial and widespread in prokaryotes.",2011,,2020-05-18 13:59:19,2020-05-18 13:59:18,375-386,,2,110,,,"Structure, function and regulation of the DNA-binding protein Dps and its role in acid and oxidative stress resistance in Escherichia coli",,,,,,,en,© 2010 The Authors.

Various TCSs are involved in the acid resistance of bacteria. The EvgS–EvgA system is a TCS that confers acid resistance to Escherichia coli cells. Activation of the sensor EvgS initiates a cascade of transcription factors, EvgA, YdeO, and GadE, which induce the expression of a large group of acid resistance genes. EvgS activation also activates another TCS, the PhoQ–PhoP system, via a small connector protein, SafA. In this chapter, a model of signal transduction cascade proceeding from EvgS–EvgA to PhoQ–PhoP and then to RssB (connected by SafA and IraM), as well as how this cascade contributes to acid resistance, is discussed. Furthermore, we searched for signals activating EvgS and found that a high concentration of alkali metals (Na+ and K+) and low pH were essential for the activation. The periplasmic sensor region of EvgS was necessary for EvgS activation, but the cytoplasmic linker domain, which connects the transmembrane region and the histidine kinase domain, was also required for low-pH perception. These results suggested the complexity of the acid resistance gene regulation involving TCSs and also how the pH message is perceived.",2016,,2020-05-18 14:18:55,2020-05-18 14:18:55,927-934,,,,,,,,,,,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",,en,"Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

EvgS, the sensor kinase, is one of five unconventional histidine kinases (HKs) in E. coli and has a large periplasmic domain and a cytoplasmic PAS domain in addition to phospho-acceptor, HK and dimerization, internal receiver, and phosphotransfer domains. Mutations that constitutively activate the protein at pH 7 map to the PAS domain. Here, we built a homology model of the periplasmic region of EvgS, based on the structure of the equivalent region of the BvgS homologue, to guide mutagenesis of potential key residues in this region. We show that histidine 226 is required for induction and that it is structurally colocated with a proline residue (P522) at the top of the predicted transmembrane helix that is expected to play a key role in passing information to the cytoplasmic domains. We also show that the constitutive mutations in the PAS domain can be further activated by low external pH. Expression of the cytoplasmic part of the protein alone also gives constitutive activation, which is lost if the constitutive PAS mutations are present. These findings are consistent with a model in which EvgS senses both external and internal pH and is activated by a shift from a tight inactive to a weak active dimer, and we present an analysis of the purified cytoplasmic portion of EvgS that supports this., IMPORTANCE One of the ways bacteria sense their environment is through two-component systems, which have one membrane-bound protein to do the sensing and another inside the cell to turn genes on or off in response to what the membrane-bound protein has detected. The membrane-bound protein must thus be able to detect the stress and signal this detection event to the protein inside the cell. To understand this process, we studied a protein that helps E. coli to survive exposure to low pH, which it must do before taking up residence in the gastrointestinal tract. We describe a predicted structure for the main sensing part of the protein and identify some key residues within it that are involved in the sensing and signaling processes. We propose a mechanism for how the protein may become activated and present some evidence to support our proposal.",2017-08-22,,2020-05-26 13:41:09,2020-05-26 13:41:09,,,18,199,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 28674068 PMCID: PMC5573083,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/FH4384VG/Sen et al. - 2017 - Structural and Functional Analysis of the Escheric.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5573083/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Biochemistry, Genetics",Escherichia coli,MG1655,M9 medium,"5.6

Of the four E. coli systems that contribute to acid resistance, one, the glutamate-dependent system, is remarkable in its efficacy and regulatory complexity. The resistance mechanism involves the intracellular consumption of protons by the glutamate decarboxylase isozymes GadA and GadB. The antiporter GadC then exports the product, γ-aminobutyric acid, in exchange for fresh glutamate. A microarray study using overexpressed regulators uncovered evgAS and ydeO as potential regulators of gadE, now known to encode the essential activator of the gadA and gadBC genes. Examination of evgA and ydeO under normal expression conditions revealed that their products do activate gadE expression but only under specific conditions. They were important during exponential growth in acidified minimal medium containing glucose but were unnecessary for gadE expression in stationary-phase cells grown in complex medium. The response regulator EvgA activates gadE directly and indirectly via induction of the AraC-like regulator ydeO. Evidence obtained using gadE-lacZ operon fusions also revealed that GadE was autoinduced. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that EvgA, YdeO, and GadE bind to different regions upstream of gadE, indicating they all act directly at the gadE promoter. Since GadE controls the expression of numerous genes besides gadA and gadBC, the relevance of these regulatory circuits extends beyond acid resistance.",2004-11-01,,2020-05-13 14:21:56,2020-05-13 14:21:56,7378-7389,,21,186,,,,,,,,,,en,Copyright © 2004 American Society for Microbiology,,,,jb.asm.org,,Publisher: American Society for Microbiology Journals Section: GENE REGULATION PMID: 15489450,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/5WCLJSDB/Ma et al. - 2004 - Characterization of EvgAS-YdeO-GadE Branched Regul.pdf; ; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/243SLXMF/7378.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15489450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Genetics,Escherichia coli,"EK298

In our study, L. monocytogenes was shown to exhibit a significant adaptive acid tolerance response following a 1-h exposure to mild acid (pH 5.5), which is capable of protecting cells from severe acid stress (pH 3.5). Susceptibility to pH 3.5 acid is growth phase dependent. Stationary-phase Listeria cultures are naturally resistant to the challenge pH (pH 3.5), while exponential-phase cultures require adaptation at pH 5.5 to induce acid tolerance. Adaptation requires protein synthesis, since treatment with chloramphenicol prevents the development of acid tolerance. Induction of the acid tolerance response also protects L. monocytogenes against the effect of other environmental stresses. Acid-adapted cells demonstrate increased tolerance toward thermal stress, osmotic stress, crystal violet, and ethanol. Following prolonged exposure of L. monocytogenes to pH 3.5, we isolated mutants which constitutively demonstrate increased acid tolerance at all stages of the growth cycle. These mutants do not display full acid tolerance, but their resistance to low pH can be further increased following adaptation to mild-acid conditions. The mutants demonstrated increased lethality for mice relative to that of the wild type when inoculated by the intraperitoneal route. When administered as lower inocula, the mutants reached higher levels in the spleens of infected mice than did the wild type.

Earlier reports described three AR systems in E. coli. In the present study, the genetics and control of these three systems have been more clearly defined. Expression of the first AR system (designated the oxidative or glucose-repressed AR system) was previously shown to require the alternative sigma factor RpoS. Consistent with glucose repression, this system also proved to be dependent in many situations on the cyclic AMP receptor protein. The second AR system required the addition of arginine during pH 2.5 acid challenge, the structural gene for arginine decarboxylase (adiA), and the regulator cysB, confirming earlier reports. The third AR system required glutamate for protection at pH 2.5, one of two genes encoding glutamate decarboxylase (gadA or gadB), and the gene encoding the putative glutamate:γ-aminobutyric acid antiporter (gadC). Only one of the two glutamate decarboxylases was needed for protection at pH 2.5. However, survival at pH 2 required both glutamate decarboxylase isozymes. Stationary phase and acid pH regulation of the gad genes proved separable. Stationary-phase induction of gadA and gadB required the alternative sigma factor ςS encoded by rpoS. However, acid induction of these enzymes, which was demonstrated to occur in exponential- and stationary-phase cells, proved to be ςS independent. Neither gad gene required the presence of volatile fatty acids for induction. The data also indicate that AR via the amino acid decarboxylase systems requires more than an inducible decarboxylase and antiporter. Another surprising finding was that the ςS-dependent oxidative system, originally thought to be acid induced, actually proved to be induced following entry into stationary phase regardless of the pH. However, an inhibitor produced at pH 8 somehow interferes with the activity of this system, giving the illusion of acid induction. The results also revealed that the AR system affording the most effective protection at pH 2 in complex medium (either Luria-Bertani broth or brain heart infusion broth plus 0.4% glucose) is the glutamate-dependent GAD system. Thus, E. coli possesses three overlapping acid survival systems whose various levels of control and differing requirements for activity ensure that at least one system will be available to protect the stationary-phase cell under naturally occurring acidic environments.",1999-06,,2020-05-13 13:56:04,2020-05-13 13:56:04,3525-3535,,11,181,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 10348866 PMCID: PMC93821,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/Z7APYQC7/Castanie-Cornet et al. - 1999 - Control of Acid Resistance in Escherichia coli.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC93821/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, biochemistry",Escherichia coli,"EK181

In this study, we examine the chromosomal and plasmid transcriptomes of two different L. monocytogenes strains, 6179 [belonging to sequence type (ST) 121] and R479a (ST8), in response to 30 min exposure to oxidative (0.01% hydrogen peroxide) and acid (1% lactic acid, pH 3.4) stress. The exposure to oxidative stress resulted in 102 and 9 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the chromosomal transcriptomes of 6179 and R479a, respectively. In contrast, 2280 and 2151 DE genes were observed in the respective chromosomal transcriptomes of 6179 and R479a in response to lactic acid stress. During lactic acid stress, we observed upregulation of numerous genes known to be involved in the L. monocytogenes stress response, including multiple members of the σB regulon, many of which have not been functionally characterized. Among these genes, homologs of lmo2230 were highly upregulated in both strains. Most notably, the σB-dependent non-coding RNA Rli47 was by far the most highly expressed gene in both 6179 and R479a, accounting for an average of 28 and 38% of all mapped reads in the respective chromosomal transcriptomes. In response to oxidative stress, one DE gene was identified in the 6179 plasmid transcriptome, and no DE genes were observed in the transcriptome of the R479a plasmid. However, lactic acid exposure resulted in upregulation of the stress response gene clpL, among others, on the 6179 plasmid. In R479a, a number of uncharacterized plasmid genes were upregulated, indicating a potential role in stress response. Furthermore, an average of 65% of all mapped transcriptome reads for the R479a plasmid following acid stress were mapped to an intergenic region bearing similarity to riboswitches involved in transition metal resistance. The results of this study support the conclusion that members of the σB regulon, particularly lmo2230 and the non-coding RNA Rli47, play an integral role in the response of L. monocytogenes to acid stress. Furthermore, we report the first global transcriptome sequencing analysis of L. monocytogenes plasmid gene expression and identify a putative, plasmid-encoded riboswitch with potential involvement in response to acid exposure.",2020-01-21,,2020-04-28 13:48:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/QYQPB2QG/Cortes et al. - 2020 - Transcriptome Sequencing of Listeria monocytogenes.pdf;,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338717173_Transcriptome_Sequencing_of_Listeria_monocytogenes_Reveals_Major_Gene_Expression_Changes_in_Response_to_Lactic_Acid_Stress_Exposure_but_a_Less_Pronounced_Response_to_Oxidative_Stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Transcriptomics, proteomics",Listeria monocytogenes,"6179

Escherichia coli contains several acid resistance systems that protect cells to pH 2. One acid resistance system, acid resistance system 2 (AR2), requires extracellular glutamate, while another (AR3) requires extracellular arginine. Little is known about how these systems protect cells from acid stress. AR2 and AR3 are thought to consume intracellular protons through amino acid decarboxylation. Antiport mechanisms then exchange decarboxylation products for new amino acid substrates. This form of proton consumption could maintain an internal pH (pHi) conducive to cell survival. The model was tested by estimating the pHi and transmembrane potential (ΔΨ) of cells acid stressed at pH 2.5. During acid challenge, glutamate- and arginine-dependent systems elevated pHi from 3.6 to 4.2 and 4.7, respectively. However, when pHi was manipulated to 4.0 in the presence or absence of glutamate, only cultures challenged in the presence of glutamate survived, indicating that a physiological parameter aside from pHi was also important. Measurements of ΔΨ indicated that amino acid-dependent acid resistance systems help convert membrane potential from an inside negative to inside positive charge, an established acidophile strategy used to survive extreme acidic environments. Thus, reversing ΔΨ may be a more important acid resistance strategy than maintaining a specific pHi value.",2004-09,,2020-05-13 13:59:09,2020-05-13 13:59:09,6032-6041,,18,186,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15342572 PMCID: PMC515135,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/YL6NSTDS/Richard et Foster - 2004 - Escherichia coli Glutamate- and Arginine-Dependent.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC515135/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Escherichia coli,"EK227

E. coli and S. Typhimurium can undergo large changes in intracellular osmolality (up to 1.8 Osmol/kg) and can tolerate cytoplasmic acidification to at least pHi 5.6. Recent analyses of single cells challenged a long held view that bacteria respond to extracellular acid stress by rapid acidification followed by a rapid recovery. It is now appreciated that both S. Typhimurium and E. coli maintain an acidic cytoplasm through the actions of the outer membrane protein regulator OmpR via its regulation of distinct signaling pathways. However, a comprehensive comparison of OmpR regulons between S. Typhimurium and E. coli is lacking. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of wild-type and ompR null strains of the intracellular pathogen S. Typhimurium and a commensal E. coli in response to acid and osmotic stress. Herein, we classify distinct OmpR regulons and also identify shared OmpR regulatory pathways between S. Typhimurium and E. coli in response to acid and osmotic stress.

However, the role of SspA in gene expression in Escherichia coli is essentially unknown. In this work, we show that SspA is essential for cell survival during acid-induced stress. Apparently, SspA inhibits stationary-phase accumulation of H-NS, a global regulator which functions mostly as a repressor, thereby derepressing multiple stress defence systems including those for acid stress and nutrient starvation. Consequently, the gene expression pattern of the H-NS regulon is altered in the sspA mutant, leading to acid-sensitive and hypermotile phenotypes. Thus, our study indicates that SspA is a global regulator, which acts upstream of H-NS, and thereby plays an important role in the stress response of E. coli during stationary phase. In addition, our results indicate that the expression of the H-NS regulon is sensitive to small changes in the cellular level of H-NS, enabling the cell to response rapidly to environment cues. As SspA and H-NS are highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria, of which many are pathogenic, the global role of SspA in the stress response and pathogenesis is discussed.",2005,,2020-05-26 14:56:22,2020-05-26 14:56:22,719-734,,3,56,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04567.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/723DY9KT/Hansen et al. - 2005 - SspA is required for acid resistance in stationary.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/F94CGYIX/j.1365-2958.2005.04567.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Biochemistry, genetics",Escherichia coli,"MG1655

We found that the Shiga Toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O157:H7 NGY9 grows more quickly than a K-12 strain in Luria–Bertani (LB)-2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) broth supplemented with acetic acid (pH 5.4). Hypothesizing that the resistance of STEC O157:H7 to acetic acid is as a result of a mechanism(s) other than those known, we screened for STEC mutants sensitive to acetic acid. NGY9 was subjected to mini-Tn5 mutagenesis and, from 50 000 colonies, five mutants that showed a clear acetic acid-sensitive phenotype were isolated. The insertion of mini-Tn5 in three mutants occurred at the fcl, wecA (rfe) and wecB (rffE) genes and caused loss of surface O-polysaccharide, loss of both O-polysaccharide and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and loss of ECA respectively. The other two mutants showed inactivation of the waaG (rfaG) gene but at different positions that caused a deep rough mutant with loss of the outer core oligosaccharide of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as phenotypic loss of O-polysaccharide and ECA. With the introduction of plasmids carrying the fcl, wecA, wecB and waaG genes, respectively, all mutants were complemented in their production of O-polysaccharide and ECA, and normal growth was restored in organic acid-rich culture conditions. We also found that the growth of Salmonella LPS mutants Ra, Rb1, Rc, Rd1, Rd2 and Re was suppressed in the presence of acetic acid compared with that of the parents. These results suggest that the full expression of LPS (including O-polysaccharide) and ECA is indispensable to the resistance against acetic acid and other short chain fatty acids in STEC O157:H7 and Salmonella. To the best of our knowledge, this is a newly identified physiological role for O-polysaccharide and ECA as well as an acid resistance mechanism.",2002,,2020-05-26 13:53:11,2020-05-26 13:53:11,629-640,,3,43,,,Involvement of surface polysaccharides in the organic acid resistance of Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02768.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/829JH8WI/Barua et al. - 2002 - Involvement of surface polysaccharides in the orga.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/S82LBRRR/j.1365-2958.2002.02768.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Growth behviour, genetics",Escherichia coli,"O157:H7

Although UdhA has been extensively used in metabolic engineering and biocatalysis for cofactor regeneration, its role in acid resistance has not been reported. Here we used DNA microarray to explore the impact of UdhA on transcript levels. We demonstrated that during growth on acetate, the expression of genes involved in the respiratory chain and Gad acid resistance system was inhibited in the udhA-knockout strain. The deletion of udhA significantly repressed the expression of six genes (gadA, gadB, gadC, gadE, hdeA and hdeB) which are involved in Gad acid resistance and resulted in low survival of the bacterium at a low pH of 4.9. Moreover, UdhA was essential for NADH production which is important for the adaptive growth of E. coli on acetate, while NADH concentration in the udhA-knockout strain was quite low and supplemental NADH significantly increased the expression of acid resistance genes and survival of the udhA-knockout strain.

We extracted HdeB from bacteria by the osmotic-shock procedure and purified it to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. HdeB has a molecular mass of 10 kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which matches its expected molecular mass. We purified the acid stress chaperone HdeA in parallel in order to compare the two chaperones. The hdeA and hdeB mutants both display reduced viability upon acid stress, and only the HdeA/HdeB expression plasmid can restore their viability to close to the wild-type level, suggesting that both proteins are required for optimal protection of the bacterial periplasm against acid stress. Periplasmic extracts from both mutants aggregate at acidic pH, suggesting that HdeA and HdeB are required for protein solubilization. At pH 2, the aggregation of periplasmic extracts is prevented by the addition of HdeA, as previously reported, but is only slightly reduced by HdeB. At pH 3, however, HdeB is more efficient than HdeA in preventing periplasmic-protein aggregation. The solubilization of several model substrate proteins at acidic pH supports the hypothesis that, in vitro, HdeA plays a major role in protein solubilization at pH 2 and that both proteins are involved in protein solubilization at pH 3. Like HdeA, HdeB exposes hydrophobic surfaces at acidic pH, in accordance with the appearance of its chaperone properties at acidic pH. HdeB, like HdeA, dissociates from dimers at neutral pH into monomers at acidic pHs, but its dissociation is complete at pH 3 whereas that of HdeA is complete at a more acidic pH. Thus, we can conclude that Escherichia coli possesses two acid stress chaperones that prevent periplasmic-protein aggregation at acidic pH.",2007-01-15,,2020-05-18 14:03:00,2020-05-18 14:03:00,603-610,,2,189,,,,,,,,,,en,Copyright © 2007 American Society for Microbiology,,,,jb.asm.org,,Publisher: American Society for Microbiology Journals Section: ENZYMES AND PROTEINS PMID: 17085547,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/7EU8ALSW/Kern et al. - 2007 - Escherichia coli HdeB Is an Acid Stress Chaperone.pdf; ; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/MWWEXH6Q/603.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17085547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Growth behaviour, molecular biology",Escherichia coli,BL21(DE3),LB,"2

As part of this, the universal stress protein A (UspA) and its homologues, initially discovered in Escherichia coli K-12 were shown to possess an important role in stress resistance and growth in several bacterial species. Methods and Findings We conducted a study to assess the role of three homologous proteins containing the UspA domain in the facultative intracellular human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes under different stress conditions. The growth properties of three UspA deletion mutants (Δlmo0515, Δlmo1580 and Δlmo2673) were examined either following challenge with a sublethal concentration of hydrogen peroxide or under acidic conditions. We also examined their ability for intracellular survival within murine macrophages. Virulence and growth of usp mutants were further characterized in invertebrate and vertebrate infection models. Tolerance to acidic stress was clearly reduced in Δlmo1580 and Δlmo0515, while oxidative stress dramatically diminished growth in all mutants. Survival within macrophages was significantly decreased in Δlmo1580 and Δlmo2673 as compared to the wild-type strain. Viability of infected Galleria mellonella larvae was markedly higher when injected with Δlmo1580 or Δlmo2673 as compared to wild-type strain inoculation, indicating impaired virulence of bacteria lacking these usp genes. Finally, we observed severely restricted growth of all chromosomal deletion mutants in mice livers and spleens as compared to the load of wild-type bacteria following infection.

Many of these conditions cause protein unfolding in the cell and have detrimental impact on the survival of the organism. A group of unrelated, stress-specific molecular chaperones have been shown to play essential roles in the survival of these stress conditions. While fully folded and chaperone-inactive before stress, these proteins rapidly unfold and become chaperone-active under specific stress conditions. Once activated, these conditionally disordered chaperones bind to a large number of different aggregation-prone proteins, prevent their aggregation and either directly or indirectly facilitate protein refolding upon return to non-stress conditions. The primary approach for gaining a more detailed understanding about the mechanism of their activation and client recognition involves the purification and subsequent characterization of these proteins using in vitro chaperone assays. Follow-up in vivo stress assays are absolutely essential to independently confirm the obtained in vitro results. This protocol describes in vitro and in vivo methods to characterize the chaperone activity of E. coli HdeB, an acid-activated chaperone. Light scattering measurements were used as a convenient read-out for HdeB's capacity to prevent acid-induced aggregation of an established model client protein, MDH, in vitro. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were applied to reveal complex formation between HdeB and its client protein LDH, to shed light into the fate of client proteins upon their return to non-stress conditions. Enzymatic activity assays of the client proteins were conducted to monitor the effects of HdeB on pH-induced client inactivation and reactivation. Finally, survival studies were used to monitor the influence of HdeB's chaperone function in vivo.",2016-10-23,,2020-05-18 14:05:30,2020-05-18 14:05:30,e54527,,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,www.jove.com,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/8HGM95WL/detection-ph-dependent-activity-escherichia-coli-chaperone-hdeb-vitro.html; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/NM773ZKT/Dahl et al. - 2016 - Detection of the pH-dependent Activity of Escheric.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Escherichia coli,MG1655,LB,"2

Four acid response systems involved in reducing the concentration of intracellular protons have been identified so far. However, it is still unclear to what extent the regulation of other important cellular functions may be required for survival in acid conditions. Here, we have combined molecular and phenotypic analysis of wild-type and mutant strains with computational network inference to identify molecular pathways underlying E. coli response to mild and strong acid conditions. The interpretative model we have developed led to the hypothesis that a complex transcriptional programme, dependent on the two-component system regulator OmpR and involving a switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, may be key for survival. Experimental validation has shown that the OmpR is responsible for controlling a sizeable component of the transcriptional programme to acid exposure.

A two-component system CpxRA directly senses acidification through protonation of CpxA periplasmic histidine residues, and upregulates the fabA and fabB genes, leading to increased production of unsaturated fatty acids.

On the other hand, mutations at the rpoS locus have frequently been detected among pathogenic as well as commensal strains of Escherichia coli. The objective of this study was to perform a functional analysis of the RpoS-mediated stress responses of enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains from food-borne outbreaks. E. coli strains belonging to serotypes O157:H7, O111:H11, and O26:H11 exhibited polymorphisms for two phenotypes widely used to monitor rpoS mutations, heat tolerance and glycogen synthesis, as well as for two others, alkali tolerance and adherence to Caco-2 cells. However, these strains synthesized the oxidative acid resistance system through an rpoS-dependent pathway. During the transition from mildly acidic growth conditions (pH 5.5) to alkaline stress (pH 10.2), cell survival was dependent on rpoS functionality. Some strains were able to overcome negative regulation by RpoS and induced higher β-galactosidase activity without compromising their acid resistance. There were no major differences in the DNA sequences in the rpoS coding regions among the tested strains. The heterogeneity of rpoS-dependent phenotypes observed for stress-related phenotypes was also evident in the Caco-2 cell adherence assay. Wild-type O157:H7 strains with native rpoS were less adherent than rpoS-complemented counterpart strains, suggesting that rpoS functionality is needed. These results show that some pathogenic E. coli strains can maintain their acid tolerance capability while compromising other RpoS-dependent stress responses. Such adaptation processes may have significant impact on a pathogen's survival in food processing environments, as well in the host's stomach and intestine.",2006-07-01,,2020-05-18 15:52:06,2020-05-18 15:52:06,4978-4986,,7,72,,Appl.

To identify the genes needed for survival in extreme acid, a microliter screening procedure was devised. Colonies from a Tn10 transposon pool in E. coli MC4100 were inoculated into buffered Luria broth, pH 7.0, in microtiter wells, grown overnight, and then diluted in Luria broth, pH 2.5, at 37 degrees C for 2 h. From 3,000 isolates screened, 3 Tet(r) strains were identified as extremely acid sensitive (<0.1% survival at pH 2.5 for 2 h). Flanking sequences of the Tn10 inserts were amplified by inverse PCR. The sequences encoded a hydrophobic partial peptide of 88 residues. A random-primer-generated probe hybridized to Kohara clones 279 and 280 at 32 min (33.7 min on the revised genomic map EcoMap7) near gadB (encoding glutamate decarboxylase). The gene was designated xasA for extreme acid sensitive. xasA::Tn10 strains grown at pH 7 to 8 showed 100-fold-less survival in acid than the parent strain. Growth in mild acid (pH 5 to 6) restored acid resistance; anaerobiosis was not required, as it is for acid resistance in rpoS strains. xasA::Tn10 eliminated enhancement of acid resistance by glutamic acid. xasA was found to be a homolog of gadC recently sequenced in Shigella flexneri, in which it appears to encode a permease for the decarboxylated product of GadB. These results suggest that GadC (XasA) participates in a glutamate decarboxylase alkalinization cycle to protect E. coli from cytoplasmic acidification.

Given that IS183 is encoded in the gad gene cluster and because of its role in regulating acid response genes reported here, this RNA has been renamed GadY. We show that GadY exists in three forms, a long form consisting of 105 nucleotides and two processed forms, consisting of 90 and 59 nucleotides. The expression of this small RNA is highly induced during stationary phase in a manner that is dependent on the alternative sigma factor σS. Overexpression of the three GadY RNA forms resulted in increased levels of the mRNA encoding the GadX transcriptional activator, which in turn caused increased levels of the GadA and GadB glutamate decarboxylases. A promoter mutation which abolished gadY expression resulted in a reduction in the amount of gadX mRNA during stationary phase. The gadY gene was shown to overlap the 3′ end of the gadX gene, and this overlap region was found to be necessary for the GadY-dependent accumulation of gadX mRNA. We suggest that during stationary phase, GadY forms base pairs with the 3′-untranslated region of the gadX mRNA and confers increased stability, allowing for gadX mRNA accumulation and the increased expression of downstream acid resistance genes.",2004-10,,2020-05-18 16:11:42,2020-05-18 16:11:42,6698-6705,,20,186,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15466020 PMCID: PMC522195,,"/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/266T2X9Z/Opdyke et al. - 2004 - GadY, a Small-RNA Regulator of Acid Response Genes.pdf;",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC522195/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Genetics,Escherichia coli,"MC4100

The key proteome findings on cold, heat shock, salt, acid, alkaline and HHP stresses illustrate that the cellular stress responses in this organism are a culmination of multiple protein expression changes in response to a particular stress stimuli. Moreover, a number of key proteins may be involved in conferring the cross protective effects against various stress environments.

Similarly, general stress protein Ctc is induced in cold and osmotic stresses while molecular chaperones such as GroEL and DnaK are induced in cold and heat stresses.

In silico analysis of the L. monocytogenes genome revealed the presence of putative arginine deiminase (ADI) genes, which have been shown to play a role in the acid tolerance of other bacterial genera. In the present study, we show that L. monocytogenes possesses a functional ADI system and analysis of deletion mutants reveals that it contributes to both growth and survival of the bacterium under acidic conditions. An RT-PCR approach demonstrated that expression of ADI genes is increased in environments of low pH and anaerobicity and in the presence of arginine. A putative activator of ADI genes, namely ArgR, was identified and was shown to contribute to transcriptional regulation at this locus.

The fatty acid composition of acid habituated, non-habituated, and de-habituated exponential phase cultures is also reported. During acid habituation, monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1ω7c and 18:1ω7c) present in the phospholipids of E. coli are either converted to their cyclopropane derivatives (cy17:0 and cy19:0), or replaced by saturated fatty acids.

The most effective system requires glutamate in the acid challenge media and relies on two glutamate decarboxylases (GadA and B) combined with a putative glutamate:γ-aminobutyric acid antiporter (GadC). A complex network of regulators mediates induction of this system in response to various media, pH and growth phase signals. We report that the LuxR-like regulator GadE (formerly YhiE) is required for expression of gadA and gadBC regardless of media or growth conditions. This protein binds directly to the 20 bp GAD box sequence found in the control regions of both loci. Two previously identified AraC-like regulators, GadX and GadW, are only needed for gadA/BC expression under some circumstances. Overexpression of GadX or GadW will not overcome a need for GadE. However, overexpression of GadE can supplant a requirement for GadX and W. Data provided also indicate that GadX and GadE can simultaneously bind the area around the GAD box region and probably form a complex. The gadA, gadBC and gadE genes are all induced by low pH in exponential phase cells grown in minimal glucose media. The acid induction of gadA/BC results primarily from the acid induction of gadE. Constitutive expression of GadE removes most pH control over the glutamate decarboxylase and antiporter genes. The small amount of remaining pH control is governed by GadX and W. The finding that gadE mutations also diminish the effectiveness of the other two acid resistance systems suggests that GadE influences the expression of additional acid resistance components. The number of regulatory proteins (five), sigma factors (two) and regulatory feedback loops focused on gadA/BC expression make this one of the most intensively regulated systems in E. coli.",2003,,2020-05-13 14:11:47,2020-05-13 14:11:47,1309-1320,,5,49,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03633.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/VELEWTT6/Ma et al. - 2003 - GadE (YhiE) activates glutamate decarboxylase-depe.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/3F4AQHWJ/j.1365-2958.2003.03633.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Molecular biology,Escherichia coli,"EK227

The AraC-family regulators GadX and GadW, previously found to activate <span class=""jp-italic"">gadA/BC in vitro</span>, are now shown <span class=""jp-italic"">in vivo</span> to directly activate <span class=""jp-italic"">gadE</span> expression, which, in turn, activates the <span class=""jp-italic"">gadA/BC</span> genes. <span class=""jp-italic"">In vivo</span> results using <span class=""jp-italic"">E. coli</span> and <span class=""jp-italic"">Salmonella enterica</span> show that these regulators actually have little direct effect on <span class=""jp-italic"">gadA</span> and <span class=""jp-italic"">gadBC</span> promoters. The numerous <span class=""jp-italic"">gadE</span> induction pathways converge on a 798 bp control region situated upstream of the <span class=""jp-italic"">gadE</span> promoter region. Deletions of this control region exposed the region between −798 and −360 nt (relative to the translational start) to be required for maximum <span class=""jp-italic"">gadE</span>–<span class=""jp-italic"">lacZ</span> expression in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and to be the primary focus of GadX and GadW control. The GadE protein itself, which binds to three GAD box sequences present between −233 and −42 nt, helped activate GadE expression in LB, but only when the −798 to −360 region was absent. These regulatory regions and proteins appear to integrate a variety of physiological signals that forecast a need for GadE-dependent gene expression and acid resistance.,",2007,,2020-05-13 14:14:58,2020-05-13 14:14:58,2584-2592,,8,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Microbiology Society Journals,,"Publisher: Microbiology Society,",,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/K37PLFYF/007005-0.html; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/3SNM83NW/Sayed et al. - 2007 - The Escherichia coli AraC-family regulators GadX a.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Genetics,Escherichia coli,"EK227

In this review, we present a current model describing how this sigma factor is thought to be controlled including an overview of what is known about stress sensing and the early signal transduction events that trigger its activation. We discuss the known regulatory overlaps between σB and other protein and RNA regulators in the cell. Finally, we describe the role of σB in surviving both saprophytic and host-associated stresses. The complexity of the regulation of this sigma factor reflects the significant role that it plays in the persistence of this important pathogen in the natural environment, the food chain as well as within the host during the early stages of an infection.

Methods and Results: The isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and categorized into persistent strains according to the frequency of the strain and duration of the contamination. The persistent and nonpersistent strains were challenged to acidic conditions (pH 2·4 for 2 h, 1 mol l−1 HCl were used to acidify the suspension) and to heat (55°C for 40 min) to receive a reduction in cell count. Listeria monocytogenes strains showed large variation in acid tolerance (over 6 log units) and in heat tolerance (3 log units). The persistent strains showed higher tolerance to acidic conditions than the nonpersistent strains (Student’s t-test, P = 0·02), but significant differences in heat tolerance between persistent and nonpersistent strains were not observed. Conclusions: The results indicate that acid tolerance may have an effect on the persistence of L. monocytogenes contamination.

To combat these stresses, enteric bacteria have evolved elegant, overlapping strategies that involve both constitutive and inducible defense systems. This article reviews the recent progress made in understanding the pH 3 acid tolerance systems of Salmonella and the even more effective pH 2 acid resistance systems of E. coli. Focus is placed on how Salmonella orchestrates acid tolerance by modulating the activities or levels of diverse regulatory proteins in response to pH stress. The result is induction of overlapping arrays of acid shock proteins that protect the cell against acid and other environmental stresses. Most notable among these pH-response regulators are RpoS, Fur, PhoP and OmpR.

One mutant harboring a Tn917 insertion in the thiT gene (formerly lmo1429), which encodes a thiamine (vitamin B1) uptake system, was found to be highly sensitive to acid. The acid-sensitive phenotype associated with loss of this gene was confirmed with an independently isolated mutant, from which the thiT gene was deleted (∆thiT). Cells of both wild-type and ∆thiT mutant that were thiamine depleted were found to be significantly more acid sensitive than control cultures. Thiamine-depleted cultures failed to produce significant concentrations of acetoin, consistent with the known thiamine dependence of acetolactate synthase, an enzyme required for acetoin synthesis from pyruvate.

We report the first distinct phenotype for this membrane modification; early stationary phase cultures of strains lacking CFA (as a result of a null mutation in the cfa gene) are abnormally sensitive to killing by a rapid shift from neutral pH to pH 3. This sensitivity to acid shock is dependent on CFA itself because resistance to acid shock is restored to cfa mutant strains by incorporation of CFAs from the growth medium or by introduction of a functional cfa gene on a plasmid. The synthesis of CFA depends in part on the RpoS sigma factor, but the role of RpoS in resistance to acid shock involves additional factors because strains with null mutations in both cfa and rpoS are more sensitive to acid shock than either single mutant strain. Exponential phase cultures of E. coli are much more sensitive to acid shock than stationary phase cultures, but survival is greatly increased if the exponential phase cultures are exposed to moderately acid conditions (pH 5) before shift to pH 3. We show that exposure to moderately acid conditions gives a marked increase in cfa transcription. The efficiency of the survival of acid shock is extremely strain dependent, even among putative wild-type strains.

Addition of methionine restores growth to 80% of that observed in untreated controls. Similar relief was seen with cultures treated with either benzoate or propionate.

This study investigated effects of cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs) on stress tolerance in the heat- and pressure-resistant strain E. coli AW1.7 and the sensitive strain E. coli MG1655. The role of CFAs was explored by disruption of cfa coding for CFA synthase with an in-frame, unmarked deletion method. Both wild-type strains consumed all the unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1 and C18:1) that were mostly converted to CFAs and a low proportion to saturated fatty acid (C16:0). Moreover, E. coli AW1.7 contained a higher proportion of membrane C19:0 cyclopropane fatty acid than E. coli MG1655 (P<0.05). The Δcfa mutant strains did not produce CFAs, and the corresponding substrates C16:1 and C18:1 accumulated in membrane lipids. The deletion of cfa did not alter resistance to H2O2 but increased the lethality of heat, high pressure and acid treatments in E. coli AW1.7, and E. coli MG1655. E. coli AW1.7 and its Δcfa mutant were more resistant to pressure and heat but less resistant to acid stress than E. coli MG1655. Heat resistance of wild-type strains and their Δcfa mutant was also assessed in beef patties grilled to an internal temperature of 71°C. After treatment, cell counts of wild type strains were higher than those of the Δcfa mutant strains.

A chromosomal pathogenicity island, termed the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), contains all the genes necessary for the A/E phenotype as well as genes for a type III secretion system and intimate adhesion. Genes in the LEE and genes involved in the synthesis of bundle-forming pili (BFP) are positively regulated by the plasmid-encoded regulator (Per) and comprise the per regulon. In order to identify factors that control the per regulon, we screened an EPEC genomic library for clones that modulate the expression of per. A plasmid clone that decreased the expression of per was isolated using a lacZ reporter gene fused to the per promoter. Subcloning revealed that YhiX, a putative AraC/XylR family transcriptional regulator, was the effector of per repression. Through downregulation of per, a plasmid overproducing YhiX reduced the synthesis of intimin, BfpA, Tir, and CesT, factors important for EPEC virulence. yhiX is located downstream of gadA, which encodes glutamate decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in acid resistance of E. coli. YhiX was found to be an activator of gadA, and the cloned yhiX gene increased production of glutamate decarboxylases (GAD) and activated the transcription of the gadA and gadB promoters. Therefore, yhiX was renamed gadX. Analysis of a gadX mutant grown in the different culture media with acidic and alkaline pH showed that regulation of perA, gadA and gadB by GadX was altered by the external pH and the culture media condition. Under conditions in which EPEC infects cultured epithelial cells, GadX negatively regulated perA expression, and the derepression in the gadX mutant increased translocation of Tir into epithelial cells relative to wild-type EPEC. DNA mobility shift experiments showed that purified GadX protein bound to the perA, gadA and gadB promoter regions in vitro, indicating that GadX is a transcriptional regulator of these genes. On the basis of these results, we propose that GadX may be involved in the appropriate expression of genes required for acid resistance and virulence of EPEC. Our data are consistent with a model in which environmental changes resulting from passage from the stomach to the proximal small intestine induce the functional effect of GadX on per and GAD expression in order to prevent inappropriate expression of the products of these two systems.",2001,,2020-05-13 14:28:09,2020-05-13 14:28:09,1133-1150,,5,41,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02570.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/6I67TDIB/Shin et al. - 2001 - An activator of glutamate decarboxylase genes regu.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BQUFL8JQ/j.1365-2958.2001.02570.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Molecular biology,Escherichia coli,"E2348/69

Glucose-grown cultures were used as a reference. At the 95% confidence level, 354 genes were up-regulated in acetate, while 370 genes were down-regulated compared with the glucose-grown culture. Generally, more metabolic genes were up-regulated in acetate than other gene groups, while genes involved in cell replication, transcription, and translation machinery tended to be down-regulated. It appears that E. coli commits more resources to metabolism at the expense of growth when cultured in the poor carbon source. The expression profile confirms many known features in acetate metabolism such as the induction of the glyoxylate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenic genes. It also provided many previously unknown features, including induction of malic enzymes, ppsA, and the glycolate pathway and repression of glycolytic and glucose phosphotransferase genes in acetate. The carbon flux delivered from the malic enzymes and PpsA in acetate was further confirmed by deletion mutations. In general, the gene expression profiles qualitatively agree with the metabolic flux changes and may serve as a predictor for gene function and metabolic flux distribution.",2002-12-04,,2020-05-26 15:00:39,2020-05-26 15:00:39,13175-13183,,15,277,,J.

One mechanism employed by L. monocytogenes for survival at low pH is the adaptive acid tolerance response (ATR) in which a short adaptive period at a nonlethal pH induces metabolic changes that allow the organism to survive a lethal pH. Overcoming acid conditions by L. monocytogenes involves a variety of regulatory responses, including the LisRK 2-component regulatory system, the SOS response, components of the ␴B regulon, changes in membrane ﬂuidity, the F0F1-ATPase proton pump, and at least 2 enzymatic systems that regulate internal hydrogen ion concentration (glutamate decarboxylase and arginine deiminase). It is not clear if these mechanisms exert their protective effects separately or in concert, but it is probable that these mechanisms overlap. Studies using mutants indicate that the glutamate decarboxylase system can protect L. monocytogenes when the organism is present in acidic juices, yogurt, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and modiﬁed CO2 atmospheres. The glutamate decarboxylase system also has a role in protecting L. monocytogenes against the acidic environment of the stomach.

Herein, we provide a preliminary biochemical characterization of GadX, an activator of the Gad system belonging to the AraC/XylS family of bacterial transcriptional regulators. The GadX protein has been purified as a chimeric MalE–GadX with a yield of 15–20 mg/l of bacterial culture. The fusion protein is fairly stable, although a conformational change occurs upon storage, which reduces the binding affinity by a factor of 2, without affecting the binding pattern. Partial removal of the MalE moiety from the fusion protein triggers the formation of a species which is likely to be a heterodimer, or a higher oligomer, of the type GadX/MalE–GadX.

In the presence of glucose, the pHi remained above 7.0 within a pHo range of 4 to 6 and decreased below pHo 4. Above pHo 4, H+ extrusion increased correspondingly, with the maximum value at pHo 5.5, and below pHo 4, a net H+ influx was observed. Without glucose in the medium, the pHi decreased, and a net H+ influx was observed below pHo 5.5. A high correlation (R = 0.75 to 0.92) between the pHi and net H+ flux changes is reported, indicating that the two processes are complementary.

The following reports on the chemotaxis and motility of the L. monocytogenes when exposed to relatively small concentrations of acetic acid. Using the developed nanoporous microfluidic device to precisely modulate the cellular environment, we exposed the individual Listeria cells to acetic acid and, in real time and with high resolution, observed how the cells reacted to the change in their surroundings. Our results showed that concentrations of acetic acid below 10 mM had very little, if any, effect on the motility. However, when exposed to 100 mM acetic acid, the cells exhibited a sharp drop in velocity and displayed a more random pattern of motion. These results indicate that at appropriate concentrations, acetic acid has the ability to disable the flagellum of the cells, thus impairing their motility. This drop in motility has numerous effects on the cell; its main effects being the obstruction of the cell's ability to properly form biofilms and a reduction in the overall infectivity of the cells. Since these characteristics are especially useful in controlling the proliferation of L. monocytogenes, acetic acid shows potential for application in the food industry as an active compound in designing a food packaging environment and as an antimicrobial agent.",2014-02-04,,2020-05-18 13:23:31,2020-05-18 13:23:31,938-946,,5,14,,Lab Chip,,,,,,,,en,,,,,pubs.rsc.org,,Publisher: The Royal Society of Chemistry,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/WK7X9VLW/c3lc51138c.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biotechnology,Listeria monocytogenes,MMB 17,/,/,Acetic acid,,

A total of 28 genes were induced in at least two of three experiments in which the gene expression profiles of cells grown in acid (pH 5.5 or 4.5) were compared to those of cells grown at pH 7.4. As expected, the genes encoding glutamate decarboxylase, gadA and gadB, were significantly induced. Interestingly, two acid-inducible genes code for small basic proteins with pIs of >10.5, and six code for small acidic proteins with pIs ranging from 5.7 to 4.0; the roles of these small basic and acidic proteins in acid resistance are unknown. The acid-induced genes represented only five functional grouping categories, including eight genes involved in metabolism, nine associated with cell envelope structures or modifications, two encoding chaperones, six regulatory genes, and six unknown genes. It is unlikely that all of these genes are involved in the glutamate-dependent AR. However, nine acid-inducible genes are clustered in the gadA region, including hdeA, which encodes a putative periplasmic chaperone, and four putative regulatory genes. One of these putative regulators, yhiE, was shown to significantly increase acid resistance when overexpressed in cells that had not been preinduced by growth at pH 5.5, and mutation of yhiE decreased acid resistance; yhiE could therefore encode an activator of AR genes.

Here, we report a periplasmic protease-mediated acid resistance mechanism in Escherichia coli. Deletion of the protease gene degP dramatically decreases the viability of late log or early stationary phase cells against the extreme acid stress (pH 2.3), which can only be minimally rescued by complementary expression of the protease-deficient DegP(S210A) mutant protein. Similarly, DegQ, a homolog of DegP, also contributes to the bacterial acid resistance, but SurA as an important periplasmic chaperone hardly exhibits protection effect. In vitro studies reveal that DegP completely loses its protease activity under acidic condition but is able to partially reactivate upon neutralization. Importantly, we demonstrate the interaction of DegP with typical cellular substrate proteins in cells during acid stress and/or recovery stages by using unnatural amino acid-mediated in vivo photo-crosslinking, as well as the degradation of periplasmic proteins by DegP during recovery after acidic denaturation. These data illustrate the role of DegP in bacterial acid resistance conceivably via degrading those acid-induced misfolded proteins. Our findings, together with earlier reports, suggest a comprehensive acid resistance strategy adopted by bacteria such that in the ATP-deficient extra-cytoplasm, the inevitable misfolded proteins induced by acid stress are refolded by a chaperone (e.g., HdeA/HdeB) and/or cleaved by a protease (e.g., DegP/DegQ) while in the cytoplasm excessive protons are directly consumed or exported.",2018,,2020-05-26 14:07:06,2020-05-26 14:07:06,3525-3538,,18,285,,,,,,,,,,en,© 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/febs.14627,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/XT3TJM8A/Fu et al. - 2018 - DegP functions as a critical protease for bacteria.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/KHVFI9WL/febs.html,,,acid stress; chaperone; DegP; protease; protein misfolding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Escherichia coli,BW25113,LB medium,2.3,HCl,2020-05-26,

Taking into account the apparent low infectious dose of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, 11 O157:H7 strains and 4 commensal strains of E. coli were tested for their abilities to survive extreme acid exposures (pH 3). Three previously characterized acid resistance systems were tested. These included an acid-induced oxidative system, an acid-induced arginine-dependent system, and a glutamate-dependent system. When challenged at pH 2.0, the arginine-dependent system provided more protection in the EHEC strains than in commensal strains. However, the glutamate-dependent system provided better protection than the arginine system and appeared equally effective in all strains. Because E. coli must also endure acid stress imposed by the presence of weak acids in intestinal contents at a pH less acidic than that of the stomach, the ability of specific acid resistance systems to protect against weak acids was examined. The arginine- and glutamate-dependent systems were both effective in protecting E. coli against the bactericidal effects of a variety of weak acids. The acids tested include benzoic acid (20 mM; pH 4.0) and a volatile fatty acid cocktail composed of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids at levels approximating those present in the intestine. The oxidative system was much less effective. Several genetic aspects of E. coli acid resistance were also characterized. The alternate sigma factor RpoS was shown to be required for oxidative acid resistance but was only partially involved with the arginine- and glutamate-dependent acid resistance systems. The arginine decarboxylase system (including adi and its regulators cysB and adiY) was responsible for arginine-dependent acid resistance. The results suggest that several acid resistance systems potentially contribute to the survival of pathogenic E. coli in the different acid stress environments of the stomach (pH 1 to 3) and the intestine (pH 4.5 to 7 with high concentrations of volatile fatty acids).

Because H(2) production involves consumption of 2H(+), hydrogenase expression is likely to involve pH response and regulation. Hydrogenase consumption of protons in E. coli has been implicated in acid resistance, the ability to survive exposure to acid levels (pH 2-2.5) that are three pH units lower than the pH limit of growth (pH 5-6). Enhanced survival in acid enables a larger infective inoculum to pass through the stomach and colonize the intestine. Most acid resistance mechanisms have been defined using aerobic cultures, but the use of anaerobic cultures will reveal novel acid resistance mechanisms. We analyzed the pH regulation of bacterial hydrogenases in live cultures of E. coli K-12 W3110. During anaerobic growth in the range of pH 5 to 6.5, E. coli expresses three hydrogenase isoenzymes that reversibly oxidize H(2) to 2H(+). Anoxic conditions were used to determine which of the hydrogenase complexes contribute to acid resistance, measured as the survival of cultures grown at pH 5.5 without aeration and exposed for 2 hours at pH 2 or at pH 2.5. Survival of all strains in extreme acid was significantly lower in low oxygen than for aerated cultures. Deletion of hyc (Hyd-3) decreased anoxic acid survival 3-fold at pH 2.5, and 20-fold at pH 2, but had no effect on acid survival with aeration. Deletion of hyb (Hyd-2) did not significantly affect acid survival. The pH-dependence of H(2) production and consumption was tested using a H(2)-specific Clark-type electrode. Hyd-3-dependent H(2) production was increased 70-fold from pH 6.5 to 5.5, whereas Hyd-2-dependent H(2) consumption was maximal at alkaline pH. H(2) production, was unaffected by a shift in external or internal pH. H(2) production was associated with hycE expression levels as a function of external pH. Anaerobic growing cultures of E. coli generate H(2) via Hyd-3 at low external pH, and consume H(2) via Hyd-2 at high external pH. Hyd-3 proton conversion to H(2) is required for acid resistance in anaerobic cultures of E. coli.",2010-04-12,,2020-05-22 08:27:23,,e10132,,,5,,PloS one,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/2YSECNUH/Noguchi et al. - 2010 - Hydrogenase-3 Contributes to Anaerobic Acid Resist.pdf;,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43202316_Hydrogenase-3_Contributes_to_Anaerobic_Acid_Resistance_of_Escherichia_coli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Biochemistry, Molecular biology",Escherichia coli,"W3110

This widely distributed process involves protein-protein interactions between two integral membrane proteins. Here we report new insights into the molecular mechanism of the regulatory interplay between the lysine-specific permease LysP and the membrane-integrated pH sensor CadC, which together induce lysine-dependent adaptation of E. coli under acidic stress. In vivo analyses revealed that, in the absence of either stimulus, the two proteins form a stable association, which is modulated by lysine and low pH. In addition to its transmembrane helix, the periplasmic domain of CadC also participated in the interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis pinpointed Arg265 and Arg268 in CadC as well as Asp275 and Asp278 in LysP as potential periplasmic interaction sites. Moreover, a systematic analysis of 100 LysP variants with single-site replacements indicated that the lysine signal is transduced from co-sensor to sensor via lysine-dependent conformational changes (upon substrate binding and/or transport) of LysP. Our results suggest a scenario in which CadC is inhibited by LysP via intramembrane and periplasmic contacts under non-inducing conditions. Upon induction, lysine-dependent conformational changes in LysP transduce the lysine signal via a direct conformational coupling to CadC without resolving the interaction completely. Moreover, concomitant pH-dependent protonation of periplasmic amino acids in both proteins dissolves their electrostatic connections resulting in further destabilization of the CadC/LysP interaction.",2013-09-19,,2020-05-26 14:20:27,,,,,426,,Journal of molecular biology,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256929964_New_Insights_into_the_Interplay_Between_the_Lysine_Transporter_LysP_and_the_pH_Sensor_CadC_in_Escherichia_Coli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biological pathways,Escherichia coli,"DH5α

It has been proposed that acid resistance in some enteric bacteria strictly relies on a glutamic acid-dependent system. The Escherichia coli chromosome contains distinct genes encoding two biochemically identical isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase, GadA and GadB. The gadC gene, located downstream of gadB, has been proposed to encode a putative antiporter implicated in the export of gamma-aminobutyrate, the glutamic acid decarboxylation product. In the present work, we provide in vivo evidence that gadC is co-transcribed with gadB and that the functional glutamic acid-dependent system requires the activities of both GadA/B and GadC. We also found that expression of gad genes is positively regulated by acidic shock, salt stress and stationary growth phase. Mutations in hns, the gene for the histone-like protein H-NS, cause derepressed expression of the gad genes, whereas the rpoS mutation abrogates gad transcription even in the hns background. According to our results, the master regulators H-NS and RpoS are hierarchically involved in the transcriptional control of gad expression: H-NS prevents gad expression during the exponential growth whereas the alternative sigma factor RpoS relieves H-NS repression during the stationary phase, directly or indirectly accounting for transcription of gad genes.",1999-06,,2020-05-13 14:02:12,,1198-1211,,6,32,,Mol.

If the bacteria had been adapted to an intermediary sublethal pH before imposition of lethal pH stress, they would have resisted better lethal pH. A prolonged treatment at intermediary pH, however, rendered the bacteria more sensitive to subsequent lethal pH. Organic volatile acids exerted a more deleterious effect on L. monocytogenes than inorganic acids at the same stressing pH. The acquired acid tolerance was conserved after several weeks of storage of the adapted bacteria at 4°C.

All test strains grew well on TSA acidified with acetic acid at pH ≥ 5·4 or malic acid at pH ≥ 4·5; two strains grew on TSA acidified with citric acid at pH ≥ 4·5, while the third strain grew at pH ≥ 4·8. Acid-adapted and control (unadapted) cells differed little in their ability to form visible colonies on TSA containing the same acid at the same pH. However, on plates not showing visible colonies, acid-adapted cells retained higher viability than unadapted cells when plated on acidified TSA. Growth of acid-adapted and control cells of E. coli O157:H7 inoculated into TSB containing acetic acid (pH 5·4 and 5·7) and citric or malic acids (pH 4·2 and 4·5) was also studied. There was essentially no difference in growth characteristics of the two types of cells in TSB acidified at the same pH with a given acid. Tolerance of acid-adapted and control cells on subsequent exposure to low pH is influenced by the type of acidulant. The order of sensitivity at a given pH is acetic > citric > malic acid. When performing acid challenge studies to determine survival and growth characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 in foods, consideration should be given to the type of acid to which cells have been exposed previously, the procedure used to achieve acidic environments and possible differences in response among strains.

The most effective system, AR2, decarboxylates externally-derived glutamate to remove cytoplasmic protons and excrete GABA. The first described system, AR1, does not require an external amino acid. Its mechanism has not been determined. The regulation of the multiple AR systems and their coordination with broader cellular metabolism has not been fully explored. Results We utilized a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression analysis to experimentally map the regulatory interactions of four TFs: nac, ntrC, ompR, and csiR. Our data identified all previously in vivo confirmed direct interactions and revealed several others previously inferred from gene expression data. Our data demonstrate that nac and csiR directly modulate AR, and leads to a regulatory network model in which all four TFs participate in coordinating acid resistance, glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism. This model predicts a novel mechanism for AR1 by which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used with internally derived glutamate. This hypothesis makes several testable predictions that we confirmed experimentally. Conclusions Our data suggest that the regulatory network underlying AR is complex and deeply interconnected with the regulation of GABA and glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism. These connections underlie and experimentally validated model of AR1 in which the decarboxylation enzymes of AR2 are used with internally derived glutamate.

We show in this report that they also form mixed aggregates with proteins that have failed to be solubilized at acidic pH and allow their subsequent solubilization at neutral pH. HdeA, HdeB, and HdeA and HdeB together display an increasing efficiency for the solubilization of protein aggregates at pH 3. They are less efficient for the solubilization of aggregates at pH 2, whereas HdeB is the most efficient. Increasing amounts of periplasmic proteins draw increasing amounts of chaperone into pellets, suggesting that chaperones co-aggregate with their substrate proteins. We observed a decrease in the size of protein aggregates in the presence of HdeA and HdeB, from very high molecular mass aggregates to 100-5000-kDa species. Moreover, a marked decrease in the exposed hydrophobicity of aggregated proteins in the presence of HdeA and HdeB was revealed by 1,1'-bis(4-anilino)naphtalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid binding experiments. In vivo, during the recovery at neutral pH of acid stressed bacterial cells, HdeA and HdeB allow the solubilization and renaturation of protein aggregates, including those formed by the maltose receptor MalE, the oligopeptide receptor OppA, and the histidine receptor HisJ. Thus, HdeA and HdeB not only help to maintain proteins in a soluble state during acid treatment, as previously reported, but also assist, both in vitro and in vivo, in the solubilization at neutral pH of mixed protein-chaperone aggregates formed at acidic pH, by decreasing the size of protein aggregates and the exposed hydrophobicity of aggregated proteins.",2008-05-16,,2020-05-18 14:03:52,,13679-13687,,20,283,,J.

The structural genes gadA, gadB, and gadC encode two glutamate decarboxylase isoforms and a glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) antiporter, respectively. Glutamate decarboxylation involves both proton consumption and production of GABA, a neutral compound which is finally exported via the GadC antiporter. Regulation of gadA and gadBC transcription is very complex, involving several circuits controlling expression under different growth phase, medium, and pH conditions. In this study we found that the AraC-like activators GadX and GadW share the same 44-bp binding sites in the gadA and gadBC regulatory regions. The common binding sites are centered at 110.5 bp and 220.5 bp upstream of the transcriptional start points of the gadA and gadBC genes, respectively. At the gadA promoter this regulatory element overlaps one of the binding sites of the repressor H-NS. The DNA of the gadBC promoter has an intrinsic bend which is centered at position −121. These findings, combined with transcriptional regulation studies, may account for the two different mechanisms of transcriptional activation by GadX and GadW at the two promoters studied.

We investigated contributions of the stress-responsive alternative sigma factor, σB, which is encoded by sigB, to growth phase-dependent acid resistance (AR) and to the adaptive acid tolerance response in L. monocytogenes. At various points throughout growth, we compared the relative survival of L. monocytogenes wild-type and ΔsigB strains that had been exposed to either brain heart infusion (pH 2.5) or synthetic gastric fluid (pH 2.5) with and without prior acid adaptation. Under these conditions, survival of the ΔsigB strain was consistently lower than that of the wild-type strain throughout all phases of growth, ranging from 4 orders of magnitude less in mid-log phase to 2 orders of magnitude less in stationary phase. Survival of both ΔsigB and wild-type L. monocytogenes strains increased by 6 orders of magnitude upon entry into stationary phase, demonstrating that the L. monocytogenes growth phase-dependent AR mechanism is σB independent. σB-mediated contributions to acquired acid tolerance appear to be greatest in early logarithmic growth. Loss of a functional σB reduced the survival of L. monocytogenes at pH 2.5 to a greater extent in the presence of organic acid (100 mM acetic acid) than in the presence of inorganic acid alone (HCl), suggesting that L. monocytogenes protection against organic and inorganic acid may be mediated through different mechanisms. σB does not appear to contribute to pHi homeostasis through regulation of net proton movement across the cell membrane or by regulation of pHi buffering by the GAD system under the conditions examined in this study.

This sequence encodes a protein of 755 amino acids with a molecular size of 84,420 daltons. The molecular weight and predicted Adi amino acid composition agree with those found in earlier work. The amino acid sequence of arginine decarboxylase showed homology to those of three other decarboxylases of E. coli: (i) CadA, encoding lysine decarboxylase; (ii) SpeC, encoding biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase; and (iii) SpeF, encoding biodegradative ornithine decarboxylase and the lysine decarboxylase of Hafnia alvei. Unlike SpeC and SpeF, Adi is not similar to the biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase, SpeA. adi is also dissimilar to cadA and speF in that it does not appear to be part of an operon containing a metabolically related transport protein, indicating that it represents a new type of biodegradative decarboxylase regulation. Transcriptional fusions between fragments upstream of adi and lacZ, primer extension, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments defined the pH-regulated promoter. Deletion analysis of the upstream region and cloning of fragments to make adi::lacZ protein fusion implicated a region beyond an upstream SspI site in pH regulation. Induction of adi in the presence of sublethal concentrations of novobiocin or coumermycin A1, inhibitors of DNA gyrase, was dramatically decreased, indicating that DNA supercoiling is involved in adi expression.

The USP was up-regulated not only in the stationary phase but also during the exponential growth phase. The three dimensional (3D) structure of USP was predicted using a combined proteomic and bioinformatics approach. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the USP from Listeria detected in our study was distant from the USPs of other bacteria (such as Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.) and clustered in a separate and heterogeneous class including several USPs from Listeria spp. and Lactobacillus spp. An important information on the studied USP was obtained from the 3D-structure established through the homology modelling procedure. In detail, the Model_USP-691 suggested that the investigated USP had a homo-tetrameric quaternary structure. Each monomer presented an architecture analogous to the Rossmann-like α/β fold with 5 parallel β-strands and 4 α-helices. The analysis of monomer-monomer interfaces and quality of the structure alignments confirmed the model reliability. In fact, the structurally and sequentially conserved hydrophobic residues of the β-strand 5 (in particular the residues V146 and V148) were involved in the inter-chains contact. Moreover, the highly conserved residues I139 and H141 in the region α 4 were involved in the dimer association and functioned as hot spots into monomer-monomer interface assembly. The hypothetical assembly of dimers was also supported by the large interface area and by the negative value of solvation free energy gain upon interface interaction. Finally, the structurally conserved ATP-binding motif G-2X-G-9X-G(S/T-N) suggested for a putative role of ATP in stabilizing the tetrameric assembly of the USP. Therefore, the results obtained from a multiple approach, consisting in the application of kinetic, proteomic, phylogenetic and modelling analyses, suggest that Listeria USP could be considered a new type of ATP-binding USP involved in the response to acid stress condition during the exponential growth phase.",2016,,2020-05-18 13:23:49,2020-05-18 13:23:49,,,,7,,Front.

Maximal acid resistance was seen when the organism was exposed to pH 5.0 for 1 h prior to challenge at pH 3.0, although intermediate levels of protection were afforded by exposure to pH values ranging from 4.0 to 6.0. A 60 min adaptive period was required for the development of maximal acid tolerance; during this period the level of acid tolerance increased gradually. Full expression of the ATR required de novo protein synthesis; chloramphenicol, a protein synthesis inhibitor, prevented full induction of acid tolerance. Analysis of protein expression during the adaptive period by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a change in the expression of at least 23 proteins compared to the non-adapted culture. Eleven proteins showed induced expression while 12 were repressed, implying that the ATR is a complex response involving a modulation in the expression of a large number of genes.

The experimental objective was to identify the primary metabolites accumulating in Escherichia coli O26:H11 as a function of acid (pH 3·6) exposure. Methods and Results Different buffers of pH 7·5 and 3·6 were used to study the metabolites accumulating in E. coli O26:H11 cells during such pH exposure. After 24 h of acid exposure, there was a 7-log decline in E. coli populations on trypticase soy agar plates. Untargeted metabolomic analysis identified 293 primary metabolites of which 145 metabolites were differentially (P < 0·01) accumulating between pH 7·5 and 3·6 in E. coli O26:H11. Conclusions After 24 h of acid exposure, 21 different metabolic pathways appeared to be functional, suggesting that the cells were still metabolically active. Among the identifiable pathways, the key differentially expressed pathways were associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis, purine metabolism, d-Glutamine/d-glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and inositol phosphate metabolism. Significance and Impact of the Study Shiga toxin producing non-O157 E. coli strains such as E. coli O26 are responsible for a growing number of food-related illnesses in the United States and around the world. From food production to consumption, micro-organisms in foods experience dramatic pH fluctuations by organic acids introduced either during food processing or by inorganic acids in the stomach. Acid exposure induces specific metabolite accumulation in bacterial cells. Understanding the survival mechanisms of pathogenic micro-organisms by studying the metabolome would be helpful in introducing effective hurdles and thus ensuring food safety.",2018,,2020-05-26 14:21:56,2020-05-26 14:21:55,1911-1919,,6,125,,,Acid stress induces differential accumulation of metabolites in Escherichia coli O26,,,,,,,en,Published 2018.

The results showed that many genes involved in acid stress are upregulated, suggesting that MgrB is related to acid sensitivity in E. coli. The survival rates under acid stress of the ΔmgrB mutant and wild-type showed that deletion of mgrB resulted in acid resistance. According to previous research, we deleted phoP, phoQ and iraM in the ΔmgrB mutant, and found that further deletion of phoP/phoQ only partially restored acid sensitivity. Additionally, we found that deletion of mgrB resulted in increased accumulation of RpoS during the exponential growth phase, which could be blocked by further deletion of iraM. Mutation of iraM or rpoS completely suppressed the effect of mgrB mutation on acid resistance.

Microarray analyses  identified a total of 55 genes with statistically significant  σB-dependent expression under the conditions used in  these experiments, with at least 1.5-fold-higher expression in the wild  type over the sigB mutant under either stress condition (51  genes showed at least 2.0-fold-higher expression in the wild type). Of  the 55 genes exhibiting σB-dependent expression, 54  were preceded by a sequence resembling the σB  promoter consensus sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was  used to confirm the σB-dependent nature of a subset  of eight selected promoter regions. Notably, the  σB-dependent L. monocytogenes genes  identified through this HMM/microarray strategy included both stress  response genes (e.g., gadB, ctc, and the glutathione  reductase gene lmo1433) and virulence genes (e.g.,  inlA, inlB, and bsh). Our data demonstrate  that, in addition to regulating expression of genes important for  survival under environmental stress conditions, σB  also contributes to regulation of virulence gene expression in L.  monocytogenes. These findings strongly suggest that  σB contributes to L. monocytogenes gene  expression during  infection.",2003-10,,2020-04-12 08:38:20,2020-04-12 08:38:20,5722-5734,,19,185,,J Bacteriol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 13129943 PMCID: PMC193959,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/LINHAJM5/Kazmierczak et al. - 2003 - Listeria monocytogenes σB Regulates Stress Respons.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC193959/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Proteomics, genetics",Listeria monocytogenes,10403S,Brain Heart Infusion broth,/,/,,

Refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods have been sources of listeriosis outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to determine whether growth at a low temperature (i.e., 7°C) affects L. monocytogenes survival or gene transcription after exposure to a simulated gastric environment (i.e., acid shock at 37°C). L. monocytogenes cells grown at 7°C were less resistant to artificial gastric fluid (AGF) or acidified brain heart infusion broth (ABHI) than bacteria grown at higher temperatures (i.e., 30°C or 37°C). For L. monocytogenes grown at 7°C, stationary-phase cells were more resistant to ABHI than log-phase cells, indicating that both temperature and growth phase affect acid survival. Microarray transcriptomic analysis revealed that the number and functional categories of genes differentially expressed after acid shock differed according to both growth temperature and growth phase. The acid response of L. monocytogenes grown to log phase at 37°C involved stress-related transcriptional regulators (i.e., σB, σH, CtsR, and HrcA), some of which have been implicated in adaptation to the intracellular environment. In contrast, for bacteria grown at 7°C to stationary phase, acid exposure did not result in differential expression of the stress regulons examined. However, two large operons encoding bacteriophage-like proteins were induced, suggesting lysogenic prophage induction. The adaptive transcriptional response observed in 37°C-grown cells was largely absent in 7°C-grown cells, suggesting that temperatures commonly encountered during food storage and distribution affect the ability of L. monocytogenes to survive gastric passage and ultimately cause disease.",2012-06,,2020-05-09 14:11:42,2020-05-09 14:11:42,3824-3836,,11,78,,Appl Environ Microbiol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 22447604 PMCID: PMC3346412,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/V9AH2FUM/Ivy et al. - 2012 - Listeria monocytogenes Grown at 7°C Shows Reduced .pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3346412/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Growth behaviour, genetics",Listeria monocytogenes,"10403S

Because of the vital function of the alpha subunit in cell growth, only a limited number of mutations in its structural gene, rpoA, have been isolated. We obtained a number of these mutants and examined the effects of these mutations on the acid induction of adi and cad gene expression. Several mutations caused a small reduction in adi promoter activity at inducing pH. One mutation, rpoA341, essentially eliminated adi promoter activity, while it had little effect on the cad promoter. During the course of a separate study, we isolated a plasmid that enhanced adi expression. Further characterization of this plasmid showed that it contained cysB, the structural gene for the positive regulator for most cys operon genes. Introduction of a cysB mutation into an adi::lac fusion strain and beta-galactosidase assay studies of the resultant adi::lac cysB mutant established that a wild-type cysB gene was required for efficient acid induction of adi expression.

In this study, we examined the role in AR of the rpoS-encoded global stress response regulator ςS and its effect on shedding of E. coliO157:H7 in mice and calves. When assayed for each of the three AR systems identified in E. coli, an rpoS mutant (rpoS::pRR10) of E. coli O157:H7 lacked the glucose-repressed system and possessed reduced levels of both the arginine- and glutamate-dependent AR systems. After administration of the rpoS mutant and the wild-type strain (ATCC 43895) to ICR mice at doses ranging from 101 to 104 CFU, we found the wild-type strain in feces of mice given lower doses (102 versus 103 CFU) and at a greater frequency (80% versus 13%) than the mutant strain. The reduction in passage of the rpoS mutant was due to decreased AR, as administration of the mutant in 0.05 M phosphate buffer facilitated passage and increased the frequency of recovery in feces from 27 to 67% at a dose of 104 CFU. Enumeration ofE. coli O157:H7 in feces from calves inoculated with an equal mixture of the wild-type strain and the rpoS mutant demonstrated shedding of the mutant to be 10- to 100-fold lower than wild-type numbers. This difference in shedding between the wild-type strain and the rpoS mutant was statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). Thus, ςS appears to play a role in E. coli O157:H7 passage in mice and shedding from calves, possibly by inducing expression of the glucose-repressed RpoS-dependent AR determinant and thus increasing resistance to gastrointestinal stress. These findings may provide clues for future efforts aimed at reducing or eliminating this pathogen from cattle herds.",2000-02-01,,2020-05-26 15:01:24,2020-05-26 15:01:24,632-637,,2,66,,Appl.

Exposure to short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, proprionate, and butyrate, at neutral or nearly neutral pH has also been shown to increase acid survival of E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. To investigate the basis for acetate-induced acid tolerance in E. coli O157:H7, genes whose expression was altered by exposure to acetate were identified using gene arrays. The expression of 60 genes was reduced by at least twofold; of these, 48 encode components of the transcription-translation machinery. Expression of 26 genes increased twofold or greater following treatment with acetate. This included six genes whose products are known to be important for survival at low pH. Five of these genes, as well as six other acetate-induced genes, are members of the E. coli RpoS regulon. RpoS, the stress sigma factor, is known to be required for acid tolerance induced by growth at nonlethal low pH or by entry into stationary phase. Disruption of therpoS gene by a transposon insertion mutation also prevented acetate-induced acid tolerance. However, induction of RpoS expression did not appear to be sufficient to activate the acid tolerance response.

Compared to reference strains that exhibited greater acid sensitivity, representative food isolates with comparatively good growth capacities in the presence of 21 mM SD at pH 5.0 accumulated reduced levels of acetate anion and K+ ion. The aciduric nature of SD-resistant strains was also reflected by comparatively high tolerance to pH 2.4 (HCl) acid challenges, a property boosted by the presence of SD. Exposure to elevated levels of SD (21 mM SD at pH 5.0) was found to have broad effects on gene expression, as differentiated from effects caused by mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.0). SD-resistant strain FW04/0025 was more responsive to elevated SD, increasing the expression of 222 genes (>2-fold change [P < 0.05]), compared to the more sensitive EGD reference strain, which exhibited increases in expression of 112 genes.

Our results showed that PsrB, but not PsrA, enhanced the survival of strain EDL933 under various acidic conditions. Transcriptional analysis using promoter-lacZ reporters and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that PsrB activates transcription of the hdeA operon, which encodes a major acid stress chaperone, by interacting with its promoter region. Furthermore, using a mouse model, we showed that expression of PsrB significantly enhanced the ability of strain EDL933 to overcome the acidic barrier of the mouse stomach.

Glutamate-mediated acid tolerance has been associated in other intestinal genera with the GAD system, in which glutamate is internalized and converted to γ-aminobutyrate (consuming an intracellular proton) that is subsequently exchanged for another extracellular glutamate via a membrane-located antiporter. Molecular analysis of L. monocytogenes LO28 revealed the presence of two glutamate decarboxylase homologues, designated gadA and gadB, that are differentially expressed. The gadB gene is co-transcribed in tandem with an upstream gene, gadC, which encodes a potential glutamate/γ-aminobutyrate antiporter. Expression of this transcript is upregulated in response to mild acid stress (pH 5.5). In contrast, expression of the monocistronic gadA message was weaker and was not induced by mild acid treatment. Non-polar deletion mutations resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of GAD activity and a concomitant decrease in acid resistance in the order LO28 > ΔgadA > ΔgadB = ΔgadC > ΔgadAB for both stationary and logarithmic phase cultures. The exquisite sensitivity of the ΔgadAB mutant to ex vivo porcine and synthetic human gastric fluid demonstrates a clear role for the GAD system in facilitating survival of the organism in the stomach after ingestion and in other low-pH environments. Furthermore, variations in levels of GAD activity between different strains of L. monocytogenes correlate significantly with levels of tolerance to gastric fluid. Sensitive strains, which include the sequenced L. monocytogenes EGD, exhibit reduced levels of GAD activity. It is clear from this study that expression of GAD by L. monocytogenes strains is an absolute requirement for survival in the stomach environment.",2001,,2020-04-13 14:47:08,2020-04-13 14:47:08,465-475,,2,40,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02398.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/LN79823P/Cotter et al. - 2001 - A glutamate decarboxylase system protects Listeria.pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/9S6KN9HV/j.1365-2958.2001.02398.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Metabolic pathway,Listeria monocytogenes,LO28,TSB-YE,3.5,lactic acid,,

The accepted model proposes that under acidic conditions extracellular glutamate is transported into the cell in exchange for an intracellular γ-aminobutyrate (GABAi). The glutamate is then decarboxylated to GABAi, a reaction that consumes a proton, thereby helping to prevent acidification of the cytoplasm. In this study, we show that glutamate supplementation had no influence on either growth rate at pH 5.0 or survival at pH 2.5 when L. monocytogenes 10403S was grown in a chemically defined medium (DM). In response to acidification, cells grown in DM failed to efflux GABA, even when glutamate was added to the medium. In contrast, in brain heart infusion (BHI), the same strain produced significant extracellular GABA (GABAe) in response to acidification. In addition, high levels of GABAi (>80 mM) were found in the cytoplasm in response to low pH in both growth media. Medium-swap and medium-mixing experiments revealed that the GABA efflux apparatus was nonfunctional in DM, even when glutamate was present. It was also found that the GadT2D2 antiporter/decarboxylase system was transcribed poorly in DM-grown cultures while overexpression of gadD1T1 and gadD3 occurred in response to pH 3.5. Interestingly, BHI-grown cells did not respond with upregulation of any of the GAD system genes when challenged at pH 3.5. The accumulation of GABAi in cells grown in DM in the absence of extracellular glutamate indicates that intracellular glutamate is the source of the GABAi. These results demonstrate that GABA production can be uncoupled from GABA efflux, a finding that alters the way we should view the operation of bacterial GAD systems.",2010-06-01,,2020-04-29 15:05:01,2020-04-29 15:05:01,3529-3537,,11,76,,Appl.

Therefore, the present study evaluated the adaptive responses to heat (52, 57 and 63°C) or lactic acid (pH 3.5) of a 10-strain composite of L. monocytogenes meat and human isolates at stationary phase, following exposure to combinations of osmotic (10% NaCl), acidic (pH 5.0 with HCl) and thermal (T; 46°C) stresses, sequentially or simultaneously within 1.5h, in tryptic soy broth with 0.6% yeast extract (TSBYE). All treatments induced adaptive responses on L. monocytogenes at 57°C, while no such cross-protection was observed at 52 and 63°C. Survivor curves at 57°C appeared convex with profound shoulders determined by a Weibull model. The highest thermotolerance was observed after combined exposure to acid and heat shock (pH–T), followed by exposure to osmotic shock, and by the combination of osmotic with heat shock (NaCl–T). Regarding acid tolerance, prior exposure to low pH, pH–T, or a combination of NaCl, pH and T resulted in a marked increase of resistance to pH 3.5, showing concave inactivation curves with tails at higher levels of survivors (log10CFUml−1) than the control cultures. The sequence of exposure to sublethal stresses did not affect the thermotolerance of L. monocytogenes, whereas simultaneous exposure to most multiple stresses (e.g., NaCl–pH–T, NaCl–T and NaCl–pH) resulted in higher survivors of L. monocytogenes at pH 3.5 than exposure to the same stresses sequentially. The results indicate that combinations and sequences of sublethal hurdles may affect L. monocytogenes acid and heat tolerance, especially in acidic environments with mild heating or in low moisture environments.",2008-02-01,,2020-04-29 13:26:41,2020-04-29 13:26:41,294-303,,2,25,,Food Microbiology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/FHLDGJVG/S0740002007001141.html,,,ATR; Multiple hurdles; Stress adaptation; Sublethal shock; Thermotolerance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biochemistry,Listeria monocytogenes,"Scott A

The consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat foods can cause infections, termed listeriosis, in vulnerable humans, particularly those with weakened immune systems. Although these infections are comparatively rare they are associated with high mortality rates and therefore this pathogen has a significant impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt to and survive a wide range of stress conditions including low pH, low water activity, and low temperature, which makes it problematic for food producers who rely on these stresses for preservation. Stress tolerance in L. monocytogenes can be explained partially by the presence of the general stress response (GSR), a transcriptional response under the control of the alternative sigma factor sigma B (σB) that reconfigures gene transcription to provide homeostatic and protective functions to cope with the stress. Within the host σB also plays a key role in surviving the harsh conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. As the infection progresses beyond the GI tract L. monocytogenes uses an intracellular infectious cycle to propagate, spread and remain protected from the host’s humoral immunity. Many of the virulence genes that facilitate this infectious cycle are under the control of a master transcriptional regulator called PrfA. In this review we consider the environmental reservoirs that enable L. monocytogenes to gain access to the food chain and discuss the stresses that the pathogen must overcome to survive and grow in these environments. The overlap that exists between stress tolerance and virulence is described. We review the principal measures that are used to control the pathogen and point to exciting new approaches that might provide improved means of control in the future.",2016-11-23,,2020-04-07 09:06:19,2020-04-07 09:06:19,,,,7,,Front Microbiol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 27933042 PMCID: PMC5120093,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/UAAHPIXM/NicAogáin et O’Byrne - 2016 - The Role of Stress and Stress Adaptations in Deter.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120093/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reviews article,/,Listeria monocytogenes,/,/,/,/,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven E. coli O157:H7 strains were grown in five different media at neutral or acidic pH under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and the survival rate after acid shocks (pH 2.0, 1 h, 37 degrees C) in the presence of glutamate, arginine and lysine was determined. Six strains induced the glutamate-dependent AR at stationary phase, and maximal survival were observed (> or =10%) when grown in pH 5- Luria-Bertani media with glucose (LBG) and in pH 4.5-anaerobic media. The arginine- and lysine-dependent systems were also present, but were only induced if cells had grown in LBG. For strain ATCC 43895, the minimum glutamate concentration that resulted in at least 10% survival rate was 10 micromol l(-1), but it required at least 10-fold more arginine and lysine. CONCLUSIONS: The lysine-dependent AR system could be as important as the arginine-mediated one, but the contribution of both systems to E. coli O157:H7 overall AR response might be minor compared with the glutamate-dependent system.

Phosphate (and/or polyphosphate) present during challenge prevented killing and damage by acid to outer membranes, DNA and cellular enzymes but did not prevent acid pHo enhancing novobiocin activity. To reverse acid effects, phosphate must interact with or cross the outer membrane but need not enter the cytoplasm; it is probable that it competes with H+ (or protonated anions) for passage through the PhoE pore. Phosphate also prevented induction of beta-galactosidase in a strain with the cadA promoter fused to lacZ.

Of the three E. coli acid resistance systems involved, the one most efficient and most studied uses isozymes of glutamate decarboxylase (GadA/GadB) to consume intracellular protons, and a glutamate:γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) anti-porter (GadC) to expel GABA in exchange for extracellular glutamate. Because acid resistance is a critical factor in resisting stomach acidity, mechanisms that control this system are extremely important. Here we show that an Era-like, molecular switch GTPase called TrmE regulates glutamate-dependent acid resistance. Western blot analysis revealed a TrmE-dependent, glucose-induced system and a TrmE-independent, glucose-repressed pathway. Gene fusion studies indicated that the TrmE requirement for GadA/B production takes place at both the transcriptional and translational levels. TrmE controls GAD transcription by affecting the expression of GadE, the essential activator of the gadA and gadBC genes. TrmE most probably controls gadE expression indirectly by influencing the synthesis or activity of an unknown regulator that binds the gadE control region. Translational control of GAD production by TrmE appears to be more direct, affecting synthesis of the decarboxylase and the anti-porter proteins.

Almost all of the persistent strains examined were highly susceptible to low pH, whereas H2O2 susceptibility was comparable to that of control strains. Two persistent strains isolated from the same sample, however, exhibited lower susceptibility to low pH. These findings suggest an acid-susceptible phenotype predominates in the habitat, indicating that environmental conditions contribute to the establishment of persistence. Representative strains exhibiting acid-susceptible and less acid-susceptible phenotypes were further investigated regarding acid response characteristics. Less acid-susceptible strains exhibited increased survival in acidified brain heart infusion (BHI) broth compared with acidified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). These strains also exhibited increased survival in acidified PBS containing glucose and glutamate, which are involved in acid response mechanisms, compared with acidified PBS alone. However, neither acidified BHI broth nor exogenous glucose and glutamate increased survival of acid-susceptible strains.

In E. coli, the cadBA operon, encoding lysine decarboxylase (CadA) and a lysine cadaverine antiporter (CadB), is submitted to the control of CadC, a positive activator whose gene maps upstream the operon, and is transcribed independently from the same strand. CadC is an integral inner membrane protein which acts both, as signal sensor and as transcriptional regulator responding to the low pH and lysine signals. Analysis of the molecular rearrangements responsible for the loss of lysine decarboxylase activity in Shigella and EIEC has revealed that the inactivation of the cadC gene is a common feature. The 3 major adaptive acid resistance (AR) systems – AR1, AR2, and AR3 – are known to be activated at low pH by Shigella and E. coli, allowing them to withstand extremely acid conditions. In this study, evaluating the survival of S. flexneri, S. sonnei, and EIEC strains complemented with a functional cadC gene and challenged at low pH, we present evidence that CadC negatively regulates the expression of the arginine-dependent adaptive acid-resistance system (AR3), encoded by the adi locus while it has no effect on the expression of AR1 and AR2 systems. Moreover, since our results indicate that in enteroinvasive strains the presence of CadC reduces the expression of the arginine decarboxylase encoding gene adiA, it is possible to hypothesize that the loss of functionality of lysine decarboxylase is counterbalanced by a higher expression of the adi system, and that CadC, besides specifically affecting the regulation of the cadBA operon, is also relevant to other systems responding to low pH.",2010-06-01,,2020-05-18 15:53:24,2020-05-18 15:53:24,289-295,,5,300,,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/WJIFA5LA/S1438422109001295.html,,,Acid resistance systems; operon; Pathoadaptive mutations; pathotype,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Biological pathways, genetics",Escherichia coli,"M90T

EHEC is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and has a lower infectious dose than most other enteric bacterial pathogens in that fewer than 100 CFU are able to cause disease. This low infectious dose has been attributed to the ability of EHEC to survive in the acidic environment of the human stomach. In silico analysis of the genome of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 revealed a gene, patE, for a putative AraC-like regulatory protein within the prophage island, CP-933H. Transcriptional analysis in E. coli showed that the expression of patE is induced during stationary phase. Data from microarray assays demonstrated that PatE activates the transcription of genes encoding proteins of acid resistance pathways. In addition, PatE downregulated the expression of a number of genes encoding heat shock proteins and the type III secretion pathway of EDL933. Transcriptional analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested that PatE also activates the transcription of the gene for the acid stress chaperone hdeA by binding to its promoter region. Finally, assays of acid tolerance showed that increasing the expression of PatE in EHEC greatly enhanced the ability of the bacteria to survive in different acidic environments.

To develop a fundamental understanding of this response, we established a molecular mechanistic description of acid stress mitigation responses in E. coli and integrated them with a genome-scale model of its metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-model). We considered three known mechanisms of acid stress mitigation: 1) change in membrane lipid fatty acid composition, 2) change in periplasmic protein stability over external pH and periplasmic chaperone protection mechanisms, and 3) change in the activities of membrane proteins. After integrating these mechanisms into an established ME-model, we could simulate their responses in the context of other cellular processes. We validated these simulations using RNA sequencing data obtained from five E. coli strains grown under external pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.0. We found: i) that for the differentially expressed genes accounted for in the ME-model, 80% of the upregulated genes were correctly predicted by the ME-model, and ii) that these genes are mainly involved in translation processes (45% of genes), membrane proteins and related processes (18% of genes), amino acid metabolism (12% of genes), and cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis (8% of genes). We also demonstrated several intervention strategies on acid tolerance that can be simulated by the ME-model. We thus established a quantitative framework that describes, on a genome-scale, the acid stress mitigation response of E. coli that has both scientific and practical uses., Understanding the acid resistance mechanisms of E. coli has important implications in the food, health care and biotechnology industries. The ability of E. coli to tolerate acid stress can be attributed to its various regulatory, metabolic and physiological mechanisms. Although different acid resistance mechanisms have been well characterized, few studies are focused on understanding how these mechanisms work together to protect E. coli from acid stress. A mathematical representation of the metabolic flux state and proteome allocation of E. coli allows the characterization of how these mechanisms interact and function on a systems-level. Here, based on an existing E. coli model framework, we characterize three acid stress mitigation responses of E. coli: 1) change in membrane lipid fatty acid composition, 2) change in periplasmic protein stability over external pH and periplasmic chaperone protection mechanisms, and 3) change in the membrane protein activities. The predictions of our framework with the integrated mechanisms demonstrated good agreement with RNA sequencing data of E. coli on gene expression changes under acid stress. The efforts here open up various opportunities for practical applications, e.g. intervention strategies that challenge acid stress tolerance and enhancement of acid resistance during organic acid production in a cell factory.",2019-12-06,,2020-05-18 14:18:07,2020-05-18 14:18:07,,,12,15,,PLoS Comput Biol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 31809503 PMCID: PMC6897400,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/E3BDLP4L/Du et al. - 2019 - Genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expressi.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6897400/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Genetics,Escherichia coli,K-12 MG1655,Glucose minimal medium,5.5 to 7,MES,2020-05-18,

The Cu tolerance system in Gram-negative bacteria is composed minimally of a Cu sensor (CueR) and a Cu export pump (CopA). The cueR and copA genes are encoded on the chromosome typically as a divergent but contiguous operon. In Escherichia coli, cueR and copA are separated by two additional genes, ybaS and ybaT, which confer glutamine (Gln)-dependent acid tolerance and contribute to the glutamate (Glu)-dependent acid resistance system in this organism. Here we show that Cu strongly inhibits growth of a ∆copA mutant strain in acidic cultures. We further demonstrate that Cu stress impairs the pathway for Glu biosynthesis via glutamate synthase, leading to decreased intracellular levels of Glu. Addition of exogenous Glu rescues the ∆copA mutant from Cu stress in acidic conditions. Gln is also protective but this relies on the activities of YbaS and YbaT. Notably, expression of both enzymes is up-regulated during Cu stress. These results demonstrate a link between Cu stress, acid stress, and Glu/Gln metabolism, establish a role for YbaS and YbaT in Cu tolerance, and suggest that subtle changes in core metabolic pathways may contribute to overcoming host-imposed copper toxicity.",2017-06-27,,2020-05-18 14:17:21,2020-05-18 14:17:21,6818-6823,,26,114,,PNAS,,,,,,,,en,©  . http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/userlicense.xhtml,,,,www.pnas.org,,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 28611214,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/NR4LCS95/Djoko et al. - 2017 - Interplay between tolerance mechanisms to copper a.pdf; ; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/SWX6GPGU/6818.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28611214,,acid tolerance; copper stress; glutamate biosynthesis; GOGAT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Biological pathway,Escherichia coli,"EC958

Accordingly, the organism has developed at least three genetically and physiologically distinct acid resistance systems which provide different levels of protection. The glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) system utilizes extracellular glutamate to protect cells during extreme acid challenges and is believed to provide the highest protection from stomach acidity. In this study, the GDAR system of 82 pathogenic E. coli isolates from 34 countries and 23 states within the United States was examined. Twenty-nine isolates were found to be defective in inducing GDAR under aerobic growth conditions, while five other isolates were defective in GDAR under aerobic, as well as fermentative, growth conditions. We introduced rpoS on a low-copy-number plasmid into 26 isolates and were able to restore GDAR in 20 acid-sensitive isolates under aerobic growth conditions. Four isolates were found to be defective in the newly discovered LuxR-like regulator GadE (formerly YhiE). Defects in other isolates could be due to a mutation(s) in a gene(s) with an as yet undefined role in acid resistance since GadE and/or RpoS could not restore acid resistance. These results show that in addition to mutant alleles of rpoS, mutations in gadE exist in natural populations of pathogenic E. coli.

The Cpx envelope stress two‐component system, composed of the sensor kinase CpxA and the response regulator CpxR, is orchestrated by the periplasmic protein CpxP which detects misfolded envelope proteins and inhibits the Cpx system in unstressed cells.

We previously showed that under acidic conditions, glutamate (Glt)/γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) antiport is impaired in minimal media but not in rich ones, like brain heart infusion. Here we demonstrate that this behavior is more complex and it is subject to strain and medium variation. Despite the impaired Glt/GABA antiport, cells accumulate intracellular GABA (GABAi) as a standard response against acid in any medium, and this occurs in all strains tested. Since these systems can occur independently of one another, we refer to them as the extracellular (GADe) and intracellular (GADi) systems. We show here that GADi contributes to acid resistance since in a ΔgadD1D2 mutant, reduced GABAi accumulation coincided with a 3.2-log-unit reduction in survival at pH 3.0 compared to that of wild-type strain LO28. Among 20 different strains, the GADi system was found to remove 23.11% ± 18.87% of the protons removed by the overall GAD system. Furthermore, the GADi system is activated at milder pH values (4.5 to 5.0) than the GADe system (pH 4.0 to 4.5), suggesting that GADi is the more responsive of the two and the first line of defense against acid. Through functional genomics, we found a major role for GadD2 in the function of GADi, while that of GadD1 was minor. Furthermore, the transcription of the gad genes in three common reference strains (10403S, LO28, and EGD-e) during an acid challenge correlated well with their relative acid sensitivity. No transcriptional upregulation of the gadT2D2 operon, which is the most important component of the GAD system, was observed, while gadD3 transcription was the highest among all gad genes in all strains. In this study, we present a revised model for the function of the GAD system and highlight the important role of GADi in the acid resistance of L. monocytogenes.",2012-05,,2020-04-12 09:12:46,2020-04-12 09:12:46,3571-3579,,10,78,,Appl Environ Microbiol,Characterization of the Intracellular Glutamate Decarboxylase System,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 22407692 PMCID: PMC3346379,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/V7RP6QL6/Karatzas et al. - 2012 - Characterization of the Intracellular Glutamate De.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3346379/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Metabolic pathway, biochemistry",Listeria monocytogenes,"LO28

Strain-dependent differences in gene transcription were observed both after exposure to shock (six genes) and after long-term adaptation to stress (18 genes). In the shock experiments, a transient induction of clpC and clpE was seen for both strains, while transient induction of sigB, inlA, and inlB was observed for strain 4140 only; actA was only induced in EGD-e after NaCl shock. The long-term stress experiments were included to imitate the stress conditions encountered by L. monocytogenes when present in food products. Long-term adaptation of EGD-e to acidic stress induced transcription of iap and repressed flaA, while genes related to stress response and invasion (clpC, clpP, inlA, inlB, prfA, and sigB) were induced in 4140.

Organic volatile acids exerted a more deleterious effect on L. monocytogenes than inorganic acids, because weak acids infer a lower intracytoplasmic pH. The responses to acid adaptation (mildly acidic pH) and acid stress (lethal acidic pH) shared the majority of acid-induced proteins.

For evaluation we used two diff erent laboratory designed models such as, agar gel diff usion test and broth reduction test. The results from agar gel diff usion tests revealed variation of the inhibition zone of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis to three engaged organic acids in concentration 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, 2%. The two tested organisms were most sensitive to lactic acid and slightly less sensitive to citric and acetic acid respectively. Listeria monocytogenes was more sensitive to all three tested organic acids compare to Salmonella enteritidis. Infl uence of above mentioned organic acids in buff ered peptone water broths revealed Listeria monocytogenes reduction in cell number by 4,6 log cfu/mL for 0.04% acetic acid and 3,1 and 2.8 log cfu/mL for lactic acid and acetic acid respectively.

The bacterium can use this faculty to maintain pH homeostasis under acidic conditions. The accepted model for the GAD system proposes that the antiport of glutamate into the bacterial cell in exchange for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is coupled to an intracellular decarboxylation reaction of glutamate into GABA that consumes protons and therefore facilitates pH homeostasis. Most strains of L. monocytogenes possess three decarboxylase genes (gadD1, D2 & D3) and two antiporter genes (gadT1 & gadT2). Here, we confirm that the gadD3 encodes a glutamate decarboxylase dedicated to the intracellular GAD system (GADi), which produces GABA from cytoplasmic glutamate in the absence of antiport activity. We also compare the functionality of the GAD system between two commonly studied reference strains, EGD-e and 10403S with differences in terms of acid resistance. Through functional genomics we show that EGD-e is unable to export GABA and relies exclusively in the GADi system, which is driven primarily by GadD3 in this strain. In contrast 10403S relies upon GadD2 to maintain both an intracellular and extracellular GAD system (GADi/GADe). Through experiments with a murinised variant of EGD-e (EGDm) in mice, we found that the GAD system plays a significant role in the overall virulence of this strain. Double mutants lacking either gadD1D3 or gadD2D3 of the GAD system displayed reduced acid tolerance and were significantly affected in their ability to cause infection following oral inoculation. Since EGDm exploits GADi but not GADe the results indicate that the GADi system makes a contribution to virulence within the mouse. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that there might be a separate line of evolution in the GAD system between two commonly used reference strains.",2014-11-11,,2020-04-13 14:38:25,2020-04-13 14:38:25,,,11,9,,PLoS One,Divergent Evolution of the Activity and Regulation of the Glutamate Decarboxylase Systems in Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e and 10403S,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 25386947 PMCID: PMC4227838,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/GLRMNBMC/Feehily et al. - 2014 - Divergent Evolution of the Activity and Regulation.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227838/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Metabolic pathway,Listeria monocytogenes,"EGD-e

Here, using in vitro fibrillation assays, transmission EM, atomic-force microscopy, and CD analyses, we found that when HdeA is active as a molecular chaperone, it is also capable of forming inactive aggregates that, at first glance, resemble amyloid fibrils. We noted that the molecular chaperone activity of HdeA takes precedence over fibrillogenesis under acidic conditions, as the presence of denatured substrate protein was sufficient to suppress HdeA fibril formation. Further experiments suggested that the secondary structure of HdeA fibrils deviates somewhat from typical amyloid fibrils and contains α-helices. Strikingly, HdeA fibrils that formed at pH 2 were immediately resolubilized by a simple shift to pH 7 and from there could regain molecular chaperone activity upon a return to pH 1. HdeA, therefore, provides an unusual example of a “reversible” form of protein fibrillation with an atypical secondary structure composition.

For example, the archetypal DNA binding protein, OmpR, is identical between Salmonella Typhimurium serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, but regulatory specialization has resulted in different environmental triggers of OmpR expression and largely divergent OmpR regulons. Specifically, ompR mRNA and OmpR protein levels are elevated by acid pH in S. Typhimurium but not in E. coli. This differential expression pattern is due to differences in the promoter regions of the ompR genes and the E. coli ompR orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introduction of the appropriate sequences from S. Typhimurium. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes (including virulence genes) that E. coli does not have. We found that OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, something that occurs in S. Typhimurium as a result of acid stress and which is a requirement for optimal expression of its virulence genes. The genomic targets of OmpR do not share a strong nucleotide sequence consensus: we propose that the ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets with its preference for relaxed DNA allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress.,  Salmonella Typhimurium is closely related to Escherichia coli and they possess identical OmpR DNA binding proteins. S. Typhimurium uses OmpR to control the expression of genes involved in adaptation to acid rather than osmotic stress. OmpR expression increases in response to acid stress in S. Typhimurium but not in E. coli due to structural differences in the ompR regulatory region. S. Typhimurium OmpR controls many genes, few of which are in E. coli. Many OmpR-regulated S. Typhimurium-specific targets have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and contribute to pathogenesis. During infection, S. Typhimurium adapts to the macrophage vacuole, an acidic niche where S. Typhimurium DNA becomes relaxed. DNA relaxation accompanies acid stress in S. Typhimurium but not E. coli and enhances OmpR binding to DNA. Drug-induced DNA relaxation mimics the effect of acid stress on OmpR binding to DNA. Thus acid-sensitive OmpR activity in S. Typhimurium allows OmpR to control many S. Typhimurium-specific genes through a mechanism that depends on changes to DNA topology. We propose that this allosteric role for DNA, combined with a weak requirement on the part of OmpR for binding site sequence specificity, accommodates flexibility in regulon membership and facilitates bacterial evolution.",2014-03-06,,2020-05-26 14:47:54,2020-05-26 14:47:54,,,3,10,,PLoS Genet,Bacterial Regulon Evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 24603618 PMCID: PMC3945435,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BE6R8KRN/Quinn et al. - 2014 - Bacterial Regulon Evolution Distinct Responses an.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945435/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,genetics,Escherichia coli,CSH50,EG minimal,4.5,Unspecified,2020-05-26,

Organic compounds such as yeast extract and tryptone were required to observe the antagonistic effect of salt and acetic acid in combination.

The addition of glutamate to phosphate buffer significantly increased the survival levels of E. coli O157:H7 after the acetic acid treatment; however, the survival levels were lower than those after the treatment with acetic acid alone.

Habituation involves protein synthesis-dependent and -independent stages; both must occur at an habituating pH. The habituation sensor does not detect increased ΔpH (or decreased Δψ) nor an increased difference between pHo and periplasmic pH but probably detects a fall in either external or periplasmic pH. Phosphate ions inhibit habituation, at any stage, probably by interfering with outer membrane passage of hydrogen ions. Most outer membrane components tested are not required for habituation but phoE deletion mutants habituated poorly and are acid-resistant. Strains derepressed for phoE, in contrast, showed increased acid sensitivity. These and other results suggest that habituation involves hydrogen ions or protonated carriers crossing the outer membrane preferentially via the PhoE pore, a process inhibited by phosphate and other anions. Stimulation by phosphate of the poor growth of E. coli at pH 5.0 is in accord with the above. Acetate did not enhance acid killing of pH 5.0 cells, suggesting that their resistance does not depend on maintaining pHi near to neutrality at an acidic pHo level.",1992,,2020-05-18 15:02:55,2020-05-18 15:02:55,233-243,,3,72,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1992.tb01829.x,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/AWGKKPHX/j.1365-2672.1992.tb01829.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Growth behaviour,Escherichia coli,"1829

For successful establishment of infection, L. monocytogenes must survive the low pH environment of the stomach. L. monocytogenes encodes a functional ArgR, a transcriptional regulator belonging to the ArgR/AhrC arginine repressor family. We aimed at clarifying the specific functions of ArgR in arginine metabolism regulation, and more importantly, in acid tolerance of L. monocytogenes. We showed that ArgR in the presence of 10 mM arginine represses transcription and expression of the argGH and argCJBDF operons, indicating that L. monocytogenes ArgR plays the classical role of ArgR/AhrC family proteins in feedback inhibition of the arginine biosynthetic pathway. Notably, transcription and expression of arcA (encoding arginine deiminase) and sigB (encoding an alternative sigma factor B) were also markedly repressed by ArgR when bacteria were exposed to pH 5.5 in the absence of arginine. However, addition of arginine enabled ArgR to derepress the transcription and expression of these two genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ArgR binds to the putative ARG boxes in the promoter regions of argC, argG, arcA and sigB. Reporter gene analysis with gfp under control of the argG promoter demonstrated that ArgR was able to activate the argG promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of argR significantly increased bacterial survival in BHI medium adjusted to pH 3.5 with lactic acid. We conclude that this phenomenon is due to activation of arcA and sigB. Collectively, our results show that L. monocytogenes ArgR finely tunes arginine metabolism through negative transcriptional regulation of the arginine biosynthetic operons and of the catabolic arcA gene in an arginine-independent manner during lactic acid-induced acid stress. ArgR also appears to activate catabolism as well as sigB transcription by anti-repression in an arginine-dependent way.",2017,,2020-04-28 13:50:47,2020-04-28 13:50:47,,,,8,,Front.

E. coli and S. flexneri strains containing wild-type rpoS maintained greater internal pH in the face of a low external pH than strains lacking functional rpoS, but the ability to survive at low pH did not require maintenance of a high transmembrane pH difference. Aerobic stationary-phase cultures of E. coli MC4100 and S. flexneri 3136, grown initially at an external pH range of 5 to 8, were 100% acid resistant (surviving 2 h at pH 2.5).

When grown anaerobically at low pH, however, the rpoS::Tn10 strains were acid resistant. E. coli MC4100 also showed resistance at alkaline pH outside the growth range (base resistance). Significant base resistance was observed up to pH 10.2. Base resistance was diminished by rpoS::Tn10 and by the presence of Na+. Base resistance was increased by an order of magnitude for stationary-phase cultures grown in moderate base (pH 8) compared with those grown in moderate acid (pH 5). Anaerobic growth partly restored base resistance in cultures grown at pH 5 but not in those grown at pH 8. Thus, both acid resistance and base resistance show dependence on growth pH and are regulated by rpoS under certain conditions. For acid resistance, and in part for base resistance, the rpoS requirement can be overcome by anaerobic growth in moderate acid.",1994-03,,2020-05-13 13:38:04,2020-05-13 13:38:04,1729-1737,,6,176,,J Bacteriol,Acid and base resistance in Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 8132468 PMCID: PMC205261,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BSBVIVM6/Small et al. - 1994 - Acid and base resistance in Escherichia coli and S.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC205261/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, biochemistry",Escherichia coli,"K-12

The dimer dissociation and unfolding processes result in exposure of hydrophobic surfaces that allows binding to a broad range of client proteins. To fully elucidate the chaperone mechanism of HdeA, it is crucial to understand how the activated HdeA interacts with its native substrates during acid stress. Herein, we present a nuclear magnetic resonance study of the pH-dependent HdeA–substrate interactions. Our results show that the activation of HdeA is not only induced by acidification but also regulated by the presence of unfolded substrates. The variable extent of unfolding of substrates differentially regulates the HdeA–substrate interaction, and the binding further affects the HdeA conformation.

Mutation of rpoN, encoding sigma factor N (σ(N)), dramatically alters the growth-phase dependent regulation of both acid resistance and the LEE. This study reports on the determinants of σ(N)-directed acid resistance and LEE expression, and the underlying mechanism attributable to this phenotype. Glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) in TW14359ΔrpoN correlated with increased expression of the gadX-gadW regulatory circuit during exponential growth, whereas upregulation of arginine-dependent acid resistance (ADAR) genes adiA and adiC in TW14359ΔrpoN did not confer acid resistance by the ADAR mechanism. LEE regulatory (ler), structural (espA and cesT) and effector (tir) genes were downregulated in TW14359ΔrpoN, and mutation of rpoS encoding sigma factor 38 (σ(S)) in TW14359ΔrpoN restored acid resistance and LEE genes to WT levels. Stability, but not the absolute level, of σ(S) was increased in TW14359ΔrpoN; however, increased stability was not solely attributable to the GDAR and LEE expression phenotype. Complementation of TW14359ΔrpoN with a σ(N) allele that binds RNA polymerase (RNAP) but not DNA, did not restore WT levels of σ(S) stability, gadE, ler or GDAR, indicating a dependence on transcription from a σ(N) promoter(s) and not RNAP competition for the phenotype. Among a library of σ(N) enhancer binding protein mutants, only TW14359ΔntrC, inactivated for nitrogen regulatory protein NtrC, phenocopied TW14359ΔrpoN for σ(S) stability, GDAR and ler expression. The results of this study suggest that during exponential growth, NtrC-σ(N) regulate GDAR and LEE expression through downregulation of σ(S) at the post-translational level; likely by altering σ(S) stability or activity. The regulatory interplay between NtrC, other EBPs, and σ(N)-σ(S), represents a mechanism by which EHEC can coordinate GDAR, LEE expression and other cellular functions, with nitrogen availability and physiologic stimuli.",2012,,2020-05-26 14:49:36,,e46288,,9,7,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 23029465 PMCID: PMC3459932,,"; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/9E5MISBK/Mitra et al. - 2012 - Sigma factor N, liaison to an ntrC and rpoS depend.pdf",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23029465,,"Acids; Amino Acid Transport Systems; Antiporters; AraC Transcription Factor; Arginine; Bacterial Proteins; Carboxy-Lyases; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Enterocytes; Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Glutamic Acid; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mutation; Nitrogen; PII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; RNA Polymerase Sigma 54; Sigma Factor; Signal Transduction; Transcription Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics,",Escherichia coli,"DH5a

In this study, we focused on the Cad module, a subsystem of Escherichia coli’s response to acidic stress that is conditionally activated at low pH only when lysine is available. When expressed, the Cad system counteracts the elevated H+ concentration by converting lysine to cadaverine under the consumption of H+ and exporting cadaverine in exchange for external lysine. Surprisingly, the cad operon displays a transient response, even when the conditions for its induction persist. To quantitatively characterize the regulation of the Cad module, we experimentally recorded and theoretically modeled the dynamics of important system variables. We established a quantitative model that adequately describes and predicts the transient expression behavior for various initial conditions. Our quantitative analysis of the Cad system supports negative feedback by external cadaverine as the origin of the transient response.

In this study the inhibitory effects of three commonly used weak acids, acetic acid, benzoic acid and sorbic acid, on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes were investigated. Methods and Results: In a chemically defined medium at pH 6·4 benzoic acid had the greatest inhibitory effect (50% inhibition of growth at 4 mmol l−1), while acetate was the least inhibitory (50% inhibition of growth at 50 mmol l−1). Mutants lacking either sigmaB (ΔsigB) or two of the glutamate decarboxylase systems (ΔgadAB) were used to investigate the contribution these systems make to weak acid tolerance in L. monocytogenes. Conclusions: The stress-inducible sigma factor sigmaB (σB) was not required for protection against acetate and played only a minor role in tolerating benzoate and sorbate. The glutamate decarboxylase system, which plays an important role in tolerating inorganic acids, played no significant role in the ability of L. monocytogenes to tolerate these weak acids, and neither did the presence of glutamate in the growth medium.

The expression of the corresponding genes is controlled by GadE, the central activator of glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR). We have previously shown by genetic approaches that as well as GadE, the response regulator of the Rcs system, RcsB is absolutely required for control of gadA/BC transcription. In the presence of GadE, basal activity of RcsB stimulates the expression of gadA/BC, whereas activation of RcsB leads to general repression of the gad genes. We report here the results of various in vitro assays that show RcsB to regulate by direct binding to the gadA promoter region. Furthermore, activation of gadA transcription requires a GAD box and binding of an RcsB/GadE heterodimer.

This acid resistance is partially abolished by deletion of ydeP, yhiE or ydeO, genes induced by EvgA overexpression. Microarray analysis identified two classes of operons (genes). The first class contains seven operons induced by EvgA overexpression in the absence of ydeO, an AraC/XylS regulator gene. The second class contains 12 operons induced by YdeO overexpression. Operons in the second class were induced by EvgA overexpression only in the presence of ydeO. EvgA is likely to directly upregulate operons in the first class, and indirectly upregulate operons in the second class via YdeO. Analysis using the motif-finding program alignace identified an 18 bp inverted repeat motif in six upstream regions of all seven operons directly regulated by EvgA. Gel mobility shift assays showed the specific binding of EvgA to the six sequences. Introduction of mutations into the inverted repeats upstream of ydeP and b1500-ydeO resulted in reduction in EvgA-induced ydeP and ydeO expression and acid resistance. These results suggest that EvgA binds to the inverted repeats and upregulates the downstream genes. Overexpression of YdeP, YdeO and YhiE conferred acid resistance to exponentially growing cells, whereas GadX overexpression did not. Microarray analysis also identified several GadX-activated genes. Several genes induced by overexpression of YdeO and GadX overlapped; however, yhiE was induced only by YdeO. The acid resistance induced by YdeO overexpression was abolished by deletion of yhiE, gadC, slp-yhiF, hdeA or hdeD, genes induced by YdeO overexpression, suggesting that several genes orchestrate YdeO-induced acid resistance.

In this study we show that YmgB represses biofilm formation in rich medium containing glucose, decreases cellular motility, and protects the cell from acid indicating that YmgB plays a major role in acid-resistance in E. coli. Our data also shows that these phenotypes are potentially mediated through interactions with the important cell signal indole. In addition, gel shift assays suggest that YmgB may be a non-specific DNA-binding protein. Using nickel-enrichment DNA microarrays, we show that YmgB binds, either directly or indirectly via a second protein, genes important for biofilm formation. To advance our understanding of the function of YmgB, we used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the protein to 1.8 Å resolution. YmgB is a biological dimer that is structurally homologous to the E. coli gene regulatory protein Hha, despite its low sequence identity of only 5%. This supports our DNA microarray data that YmgB is a gene regulatory protein. Therefore, this protein, which clearly has a critical role in acid-resistance in E. coli, has been renamed as AriR for regulator of acid-resistance influenced by indole.",2007-10-12,,2020-05-22 08:25:43,2020-05-22 08:25:43,11-26,,1,373,,J Mol Biol,Structure and Function of the E. coli Protein YmgB,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 17765265 PMCID: PMC2185545,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/ULRW88FV/Lee et al. - 2007 - Structure and Function of the E. coli Protein YmgB.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2185545/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,"Genetics, growth behaviour",Escherichia coli,Unspecified,LB,2.5,Unspecified,2020-05-22,

These bacteria have evolved at least three distinct mechanisms of acid resistance (AR), including two amino acid decarboxylase-dependent systems (arginine and glutamate) and a glucose catabolite-repressed system. We quantified the survival rates for each AR mechanism separately in clinical isolates representing three groups of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) clones (O157:H7, O26:H11/O111:H8, and O121:H19) and six commensal strains from ECOR group A. Members of the STEC clones were not significantly more acid resistant than the commensal strains when analyzed using any individual AR mechanism. The glutamate system provided the best protection in a highly acidic environment for all groups of isolates (<0.1 log reduction in CFU/ml per hour at pH 2.0). Under these conditions, there was notable variation in survival rates among the 30 O157:H7 strains, which depended in part on Mg2+ concentration.

The average survival rate for the O157:H7 clonal group was significantly less than that of the other STEC clones in the glutamate and arginine systems and significantly less than that of the O26/O111 clone in the oxidative system, indicating that this clonal group is not exceptionally acid resistant with these specific mechanisms.",2005-05,,2020-05-18 16:09:33,2020-05-18 16:09:33,2493-2500,,5,71,,Appl Environ Microbiol,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15870339 PMCID: PMC1087542,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/BVXYCMXW/Large et al. - 2005 - Variation in Acid Resistance among Shiga Toxin-Pro.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087542/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research article,Growth behaviour,Escherichia coli,"TW07591

The glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) system is by far the most potent acid resistance system in commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes and Lactococcus lactis. GDAR requires the activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GadB), an intracellular PLP-dependent enzyme which performs a proton-consuming decarboxylation reaction, and of the cognate antiporter (GadC), which performs the glutamatein/γ-aminobutyrateout (GABA) electrogenic antiport. Herein we review recent findings on the structural determinants responsible for pH-dependent intracellular activation of E. coli GadB and GadC. A survey of genomes of bacteria (pathogenic and non-pathogenic), having in common the ability to colonize or to transit through the host gut, shows that the gadB and gadC genes frequently lie next or near each other. This gene arrangement is likely to be important to ensure timely co-regulation of the decarboxylase and the antiporter. Besides the involvement in acid resistance, GABA production and release were found to occur at very high levels in lactic acid bacteria originally isolated from traditionally fermented foods, supporting the evidence that GABA-enriched foods possess health-promoting properties.",2012,,2020-05-18 15:56:46,2020-05-18 15:56:46,770-786,,4,86,,,Glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance in orally acquired bacteria,,,,,,,en,© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mmi.12020,,/Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/3H9BAZK9/Biase et Pennacchietti - 2012 - Glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance .pdf; /Users/marieluciefeger/Zotero/storage/KZVYGDMR/mmi.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reviews article,/,Escherichia coli,/,/,/,/,2020-05-18,

The hdeA (hns-dependent expression A) gene was found to be crucial for the survival of these enteric bacteria under extremely low pH conditions. We recently demonstrated that HdeA is able to exhibit chaperone-like activity exclusively within the stomach pH range by transforming from a well-folded conformation at higher pH values (above pH 3) into an unfolded conformation at extremely low pH values (below pH 3). This study was performed to characterize the action mechanisms and underlying specific structural features for HdeA to function in this unfolded conformation. In the present study, we demonstrate that the conserved 'amphiphilic' feature of HdeA, i.e. the exposure of the conserved hydrophobic region and highly charged terminal regions, is essential for exhibiting chaperone-like activity under extremely low pH conditions. Mutations that disrupt this amphiphilic feature markedly reduced the chaperone-like activity of HdeA. The results also strongly suggest that this acid-induced chaperone-like activity of HdeA is crucial for acid resistance of the enteric bacteria.

Transcriptional lacZ fusions to gadE promoter regions revealed P1 and P3 were active while P2 alone was not. However, pairing P3 with P2 activated P2 and increased expression 20-fold above P3 alone. The fusions were transferred to Salmonella, which lacks this AR system, and plasmid-borne E. coli-specific regulators EvgA, YdeO, GadE and GadX were introduced. Data revealed that YdeO and GadX activate P3, P2 and P3P2, while GadE autoactivates P1 and represses P3 and P3P2. The developing model indicates that different signals activate YdeO, GadX, or an MnmE-dependent regulator, which stimulate gadE transcription from the P3 and P2 promoters. Once made, GadE activates P1 and represses P3 and P2. The P1 region also enables efficient downstream transcription and translation of the P3 or P2 transcripts.

While nearly absent in rapidly growing cells, σS is strongly induced during entry into stationary phase and/or many other stress conditions and is essential for the expression of multiple stress resistances. Genome-wide expression profiling data presented here indicate that up to 10% of the E. coli genes are under direct or indirect control of σS and that σS should be considered a second vegetative sigma factor with a major impact not only on stress tolerance but on the entire cell physiology under nonoptimal growth conditions. This large data set allowed us to unequivocally identify a σS consensus promoter in silico. Moreover, our results suggest that σS-dependent genes represent a regulatory network with complex internal control (as exemplified by the acid resistance genes). This network also exhibits extensive regulatory overlaps with other global regulons (e.g., the cyclic AMP receptor protein regulon). In addition, the global regulatory protein Lrp was found to affect σS and/or σ70 selectivity of many promoters. These observations indicate that certain modules of the σS-dependent general stress response can be temporarily recruited by stress-specific regulons, which are controlled by other stress-responsive regulators that act together with σ70 RNA polymerase.

This is the first analysis of the pH-dependent transcriptomic response of stationary-phase E. coli. Thirty-four genes and three intergenic regions were upregulated by both strains during exposure to all acids. This universal acid response included genes involved in oxidative, envelope, and cold stress resistance and iron and manganese uptake, as well as 10 genes of unknown function. Acidulant- and strain-specific responses were also revealed. The acidulant-specific response reflects differences in the modes of microbial inactivation, even between weak organic acids. The two strains exhibited similar responses to lactic and hydrochloric acid, while the response to acetic acid was distinct. Acidulant-dependent differences between the strains involved induction of genes involved in the heat shock response, osmoregulation, inorganic ion and nucleotide transport and metabolism, translation, and energy production. E. coli O157:H7-specific acid-inducible genes were identified, suggesting that the enterohemorrhagic E. coli strain possesses additional molecular mechanisms contributing to acid resistance that are absent in K-12.

This compound is exported via the protein product of the gadC gene, which is cotranscribed with gadB. Here we demonstrate that transcription of both gadA and gadBC is positively controlled by gadX, a gene downstream of gadA, encoding a transcriptional regulator belonging to the AraC/XylS family. The gadX promoter encompasses the 67-bp region preceding the gadX transcription start site and contains both RpoD and RpoS putative recognition sites. Transcription of gadX occurs in neutral rich medium upon entry into the stationary phase and is increased at acidic pH, paralleling the expression profile of the gad structural genes. However, PT5lacO-controlled gadX expression in neutral rich medium results in upregulation of target genes even in exponential phase, i.e., when the gad system is normally repressed. Autoregulation of the whole gad system is inferred by the positive effect of GadX on the gadA promoter and gadAX cotranscription. Transcription of gadX is derepressed in an hns mutant and strongly reduced in both rpoS and hns rpoS mutants, consistent with the expression profile of gad structural genes in these genetic backgrounds.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Survival was predicted mathematically from inactivation rates at various, but constant pH values. Predictions were subsequently validated experimentally in a pH-controlled fermentor. Contrary to prediction, acid-sensitive cultures of E. coli O157 survived for a long period of time and died as rapidly as acid-resistant cultures. Experimental results showed that in an environment with changing pH, acid-sensitive cultures became acid-resistant within 17 min. Cyclo fatty acids was reported to be a factor in acid resistance. As synthesis of cyclo fatty acids does not require de novo enzyme synthesis and thus requires little time to develop, we analysed the membrane fatty acid composition of E. coli O157 during adaptation. No changes in membrane fatty acid composition were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Acid adaptation of E. coli O157 can occur during passage of the human gastric acid barrier, which can take up to 4 h. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ability of acid-adapted bacteria to survive the human stomach is an important virulence factor.
